    <h2>Free CM3 Plans</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.elego-software-solutions.com">Elego Software
      Solutions</a> would like to offer to coordinate the development
      of the Free CM3 sources, especially the core system, for the
      next time. We'll continue to produce releases and installation
      archives, integrate patches and extensions, provide installation
      and porting help, and would even offer some commercial support
      for those who want to make professional use of CM3. You should
      keep in mind that Free CM3 is a free code distribution without
      any warranties, and that the resources of help and support are
      not unlimited. If you have any questions about CM3, please mail
      to <a href="mailto:m3-request@elego.de">m3-request@elego.de</a>. 
      Please don't be disappointed if you don't get an immediate
      answer; we're just a small German company and cannot employ any
      full-time m3 support people (unless someone would be willing to
      pay for them, of course :-); but be assured that we will not
      ignore any reasonalbe questions and requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently all the sources are under CVS control at elego
      Software Solutions. We would like to setup public CVS and CVSup
      access to everything soon, but it may take a while until this
      can be realized. How things will develop will of course depend
      on the wishes and support of the M3 user community. For the time
      being, we would like to get patches in context diff or unified
      diff format from all those that want to participate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually it may be well to mix the existing PM3 and the CM3
      Modula-3 distributions, but for elego this is no short time
      goal, as there are quite a lot of incompatibilites and changes
      that make this difficult, including the build system (quake),
      documentation (html/sgml tools), language semantics
      (esp. exceptions and pragmas), and interfaces
      (e.g. text/unicode). For the time being, the two distributions
      may coexist and mutually benefit from each other. I'm already
      very thankful for the up-to-date runtime support and Unix
      interfaces I burrowed from PM3 and integrated into the CM3
      system.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is unlikely that Modula-3 will ever become a widely used
      language, but we think it has the potential to be a readily
      available and very powerful tool for those who are able to
      choose the best suited tool for some purpose. With the
      extensions CM3 5.1 provides, many of the issues known to be
      wanting in Modula-3 have been addressed or will be easier
      adressable.  We would like to keep CM3 alive as a small, quick
      to install and easy to use system. 
    </p>
