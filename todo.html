    <h2>Things To Do</h2>

    <p>
      Here is a list of things that need to be done to improve the
      CM3 5.1/5.2 distribution. If you want to work on any of them, we
      would like to be informed to be able to avoid duplicate work.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Write IPv6 and TCPv6 interfaces for M3. Create a
        backwards-compatible interface which facilitates adapting
        existing applications to the new protocols (i.e. using
        reasonable defaults etc.)
      </li>

      <li>
        Make m3gdb work again on current operating systems. Adapt the
        TEXT handling to the changes in CM3.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add real Unicode support. Probably it will be best to use
        UTF-8 as an encoding and revert to the old TEXT representation.
      </li>

      <li>
        Extend the M3 back-end interface to provide efficient support
        for exceptions through the new gcc exception handling
        interface. As the old table based approach does not work any
        more with current gccs, the M3 front-end needs to be taught
        about using this new interface then instead of the old
        EX_STACK method with generated explicit jump tables.
      </li>

      <li>
        Find a substitute for the Microsoft linker on the NT386 /
        WIN32 platform. It would also be a worthwhile project to write
        a linker in Modula-3.
      </li>

      <li>
        Make the NT386GNU platform work with current Cygwin on Windows
        systems.
      </li>

      <li>
        Test and stabilize the compiler and runtime on all existing
        platforms. Make sure all the system interfaces are correct and
        up-to-date.
      </li>

      <li>
        Build the compiler on some of the other included target
        platforms, test it, and provide a minimal binary installation
        archive. You may find the scripts provided by Elego helpful.
        <em>I would still appreciate to find some maintainers for some
          of the currently inactive platforms of CM3, who could do the
          initial bootstrap and provide installation archives for new
          releases. [ow 2003-07-19]</em>
      </li>

      <li>
        Port the system to a new target platform. We'll write up some
        porting instructions during the next weeks.
        <em>Since the first release, two platforms have been added:
          PPC_DARWIN and PPC_LINUX. Ports to other operating systems
          and hardware should be considerably easier now, as many
          tasks have been automated, and tools and quite
          up-to-date. [ow 2003-07-19]</em>
      </li>

      <li>
        Integrate and improve system documentation. The first release
        (5.1.0) will either have none or very minimal documentation.
        This needs to be done soon to make the system usable for new
        users. <em>Much has also been done in this area. The current
        documentation set should be quite usable, though it would be
        nice to have the interactive Reactor capabilities and the SGML
        documentation packages from PM3. [ow 2003-07-19]</em>
      </li>

      <li>
        Update all the database stuff (ODBC, Postgres, etc.) and make
        it compile and work with current systems. I haven't tried this
        yet, though it was one of the reasons I got involved.
        <em>Darko Volaric has done updated the database binding,
        though he says that several thing are still missing and could
        be improved.[ow 2003-07-19]</em>
      </li>

      <li>
        Extend the network objects stub generator to understand
        WIDECHARs (or does it already?). 
      </li>

      <li>
        Compile/fix/test any of the untested packages.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add Unicode support to Trestle/VBT kit/FormsVBT. This will be
        a major task but needed for lots of things.
      </li>

      <li>
        Improve the installer and installation process.
      </li>

      <li>
        Write some useful build scripts for pure WIN32 systems (no
        shell support).
      </li>

      <li>
        Improve the CM3 information and documentation at m3.org.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Things To Do Until the Official Release</h2>

    <p>
      I'd like to make an official announcement about the CM3 5.1
      release soon. I'm currently targeting the weekend at March 10th,
      but it may well take longer if more problems are found. This is
      what I'm planning to do till then:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fix most of the COPYRIGHT-CMASS texts (remove paragraph
        with email). (Done 2001-03-10)
      </li>

      <li>
        Extend the standard source distribution to contain all 
        usable packages.<br>
        2001-03-01: cm3-src-std-5.1.1.tgz contains more usable
        packages. 
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove the src-sys archive. (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Add one or two simple cmd-scripts for WIN32 users. 
      </li>

      <li>
        Add some notes about WIN32 prerequisites. (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Make the build define CM3_VERSION or something equivalent to
        that quake code can distinguish between different M3
        compilers. (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Make the installer unpack the docs if they are present. 
        (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Investigate alternative linkers for NT386.
      </li>

      <li>
        Set up some GNATS categories here for bug reports and 
        change requests, and enable e-mail access. Also provide 
        an example form. (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Recompile everything and create new archives using the 
        latest sources.<br>
        2001-03-01: Some source and installation archives have been
        upgraded to patch level 1 (CM3 5.1.1).
      </li>

      <li>
        Move cm3-unofficial to cm3 and add links on the index page. 
      </li>
    </ul>
