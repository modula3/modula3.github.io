    <h2>Things To Do</h2>

    <p>
      Here is a list of things that need to be done to improve the
      Free CM3 distribution. If you want to work on any of them, we
      would like to be informed to be able to avoid duplicate work.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Test and stabilize the compiler and runtime on all existing
        platforms. Make sure all the system interfaces are correct and
        up-to-date.
      </li>

      <li>
        Build the compiler on some of the other included target
        platforms, test it, and provide a minimal binary installation
        archive. You may find the scripts provided by Elego helpful.
      </li>

      <li>
        Port the system to a new target platform. We'll write up some
        porting instructions during the next weeks.
      </li>

      <li>
        Integrate and improve system documentation. The first release
        (5.1.0) will either have none or very minimal documentation.
        This needs to be done soon to make the system usable for new
        users. 
      </li>

      <li>
        Update all the database stuff (ODBC, Postgres, etc.) and make
        it compile and work with current systems. I haven't tried this
        yet, though it was one of the reasons I got involved.
      </li>

      <li>
        Extend the network objects stub generator to understand
        WIDECHARs. 
      </li>

      <li>
        Compile/fix/test any of the untested packages.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add Unicode support to Trestle/VBT kit/FormsVBT. This will be
        a major task but needed for lots of things.
      </li>

      <li>
        Improve the installer and installation process.
      </li>

      <li>
        Improve the CM3 information and documentation at m3.org.
      </li>
    </ul>
