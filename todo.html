    <h2>Things To Do</h2>

    <p>
      Here is a list of things that need to be done to improve the
      CM3 5.1 distribution. If you want to work on any of them, we
      would like to be informed to be able to avoid duplicate work.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Test and stabilize the compiler and runtime on all existing
        platforms. Make sure all the system interfaces are correct and
        up-to-date.
      </li>

      <li>
        Find a substitute for the Microsoft linker on the NT386 /
        WIN32 platform. It would also be a worthwhile project to write
        a linker in Modula-3.
      </li>

      <li>
        Build the compiler on some of the other included target
        platforms, test it, and provide a minimal binary installation
        archive. You may find the scripts provided by Elego helpful.
      </li>

      <li>
        Port the system to a new target platform. We'll write up some
        porting instructions during the next weeks.
      </li>

      <li>
        Integrate and improve system documentation. The first release
        (5.1.0) will either have none or very minimal documentation.
        This needs to be done soon to make the system usable for new
        users. 
      </li>

      <li>
        Update all the database stuff (ODBC, Postgres, etc.) and make
        it compile and work with current systems. I haven't tried this
        yet, though it was one of the reasons I got involved.
      </li>

      <li>
        Extend the network objects stub generator to understand
        WIDECHARs (or does it already?). 
      </li>

      <li>
        Compile/fix/test any of the untested packages.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add Unicode support to Trestle/VBT kit/FormsVBT. This will be
        a major task but needed for lots of things.
      </li>

      <li>
        Improve the installer and installation process.
      </li>

      <li>
        Write some useful build scripts for pure WIN32 systems (no
        shell support).
      </li>

      <li>
        Improve the CM3 information and documentation at m3.org.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Things To Do Until the Official Release</h2>

    <p>
      I'd like to make an official announcement about the CM3 5.1
      release soon. I'm currently targeting the weekend at March 10th,
      but it may well take longer if more problems are found. This is
      what I'm planning to do till then:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fix most of the COPYRIGHT-CMASS texts (remove paragraph
        with email). (Done 2001-03-10)
      </li>

      <li>
        Extend the standard source distribution to contain all 
        usable packages.<br>
        2001-03-01: cm3-src-std-5.1.1.tgz contains more usable
        packages. 
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove the src-sys archive. (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Add one or two simple cmd-scripts for WIN32 users. 
      </li>

      <li>
        Add some notes about WIN32 prerequisites. (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Make the build define CM3_VERSION or something equivalent to
        that quake code can distinguish between different M3
        compilers. (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Make the installer unpack the docs if they are present. 
        (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Investigate alternative linkers for NT386.
      </li>

      <li>
        Set up some GNATS categories here for bug reports and 
        change requests, and enable e-mail access. Also provide 
        an example form. (Done 2001-03-01)
      </li>

      <li>
        Recompile everything and create new archives using the 
        latest sources.<br>
        2001-03-01: Some source and installation archives have been
        upgraded to patch level 1 (CM3 5.1.1).
      </li>

      <li>
        Move cm3-unofficial to cm3 and add links on the index page. 
      </li>
    </ul>
