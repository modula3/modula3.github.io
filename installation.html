    <h2>CM3 Installation Notes</h2>

    <p>
      CM3 5.1 comes as a full source distribution contained in a file
      named 
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>cm3-src-all-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>,</blockquote>
    <p>
      a considerably smaller standard distribution
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>cm3-src-std-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>,</blockquote>
    <p>
      a (big) system archive containing the compiler, linker, and
      debugger sources for those who just want to work on the tools 
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>cm3-sys-std-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>,</blockquote>
    <p>
      and several minimal binary installation archives named
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>cm3-min-OSTYPE-TARGET-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>.</blockquote>
    <p>
      The binary installation archives only contain the compiler,
      system support libraries (if needed), m3core, libm3, and the CM3
      installer. This should be everything for a minimal but still
      usable CM3 system. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You will need to download one of the binary installation
      archives suitable for your system, and any of the source
      archives you want. You can then use the minimal binary
      installation to build any of the packages contained in the
      source distributions. Some useful scripts have been added in the
      <tt>scripts</tt> subdirectory to help with the installation and
      package build management.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have got the binary installation package, unpack it using
      the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>
  gzip -c -d cm3-min-OSTYPE-TARGET-CM3VERSION.tgz | tar xf -
    </pre>
    <p>
      You will then get the installation program, a copyright notice,
      and the installation program. Start the installer with
    </p>
    <pre>
  ./cminstall
    </pre>
    <p>
      and answer all the questions. If the installation fails for any
      reason, send mail to <a
      href="mailto:m3-support@elego.de">m3-support@elego.de</a> or <a
      href="mailto:m3-support@elego.de">Olaf Wagner</a> directly. Keep in
      mind that this is still a pre-release and may not work as
      expected. As always, please include as much useful information
      as possible in your email, especially the logfile written by
      cminstall and hardware/operating system information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If everything worked fine, extend your PATH and LD_LIBRARAY_PATH
      settings as needed, and unpack the source distribution
      archive(s) and install all the rest from source, for example
    </p>
    <pre>
  gzip -c -d cm3-src-XXX-CM3VERSION.tgz | tar xf -
  cd scripts
  PATH="${PATH}:/usr/local/cm3/bin"
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} /usr/local/cm3/lib"
