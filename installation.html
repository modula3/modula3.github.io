    <h1>CM3 5.4 installation notes</h1>

    <hr>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
    This section explains some of the terms that are used throughout
    this document. Some of them may be familiar, but in the context of
    CM3 they may have slightly different meanings.
    </p>

    <h3>Package</h3>
    <p>
      A <i>package</i> in CM3-speak is a software component of the
      CM3 system. Packages are devided into categories.
      The top-level directory of the CM3 source tree contains
      a lot of directories representing these categories.
    </p>

    <p>
      Packages have explicit import and export declarations, i.e.
      they implement the principle of information hiding on a
      higher level than modules. For details on packages see
      http://...
    </p>

    <p>Packages can be local to a given user's workspace, or can be installed system-wide,
    so other users on the system can use them, too. Installing a package
    system-wide is also called <i>shipping</i> the package.</p>

    <p>
    For example, the <i>m3-sys</i> category contains, among others,
    the packages <i>cm3</i> (the compiler user interface), <i>m3front</i>
    (the compiler frontend), <i>cminstall</i> (the installation program),
    <i>m3cc</i> (the compiler backend) and <i>m3quake</i> (the Quake language
    interpreter).
    </p>

    <h3>Quake?</h3>
    <p>
    Yes, <i>Quake</i>. Although this term has been overloaded for a while
    by a very popular video game, CM3 stuck to the name <i>quake</i>
      for its built-in scripting language for bulid management
      (replacing the UNIX make program).
    </p>

    <p>
    CM3 reads and understand so-called <i>m3makefiles</i>. These files
      have a similar purpose as Makefiles processed by UNIX make.
      This is part of the reason why installing CM3 is quite different
      from installing other software on a UNIX system - other software
      does not have make-like functionality built-in.
    </p>

    <h3>Target</h3>
    <p>
      A <i>target</i> is short for target platform and defines a combination
      of an operating system and a
      certain processor architecture. CM3 needs to know the details
      of both to work correctly. We do not consider cross-compilation
      here, and assume that you want to install CM3 on the target
      you want to run it on to produce code for the same target.
      An example target would be the FreeBSD operating system
      running on x86 processors.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Installation Prerequisits</h2>

    <h3>Check the list of known problems</h3>
    <p>
    Read the <a href="known-problems.html">known problems page</a>,
    especially the parts regarding CM3 5.4. You may run into one
    or more of the problems mentioned there while installing CM3,
    so it is a good idea to know about them in advance.
    </p>


    <h3>Supported Targets</h3>
      <p>
        For this release, the following targets are supported:
      </p>
        <table border=1>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Name</b></td>        <td><b>Description</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>FreeBSD4</td>   <td>FreeBSD 4.x and later on x86</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>LINUXLIBC6</td> <td>Linux with glibc-6 on x86</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>NT386</td>      <td>Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP</td>
          </tr>
          -->
      </table>


    <h3>Minimal Binary Installation Archives</h3>
        <p>
        To install CM3, the first thing you need is a so-called
        <i>minimal binary installation archive</i> for your platform.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The archive contains a very bare-bones cm3 installation.
        It contains a complete compiler and runtime
        libraries, but it should only be used for bootstrapping
        a full cm3 installation from source. A full installation
        contains a lot of additional tools and libraries,
        some of which are vital for common use.
        <p>
        A minimal binary installation archive is named as follows:
        </p>

        <blockquote><tt>cm3-min-OSTYPE-TARGET-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>.</blockquote>

        <p>
        <i>OSTYPE</i> is POSIX for most platforms supported by this release.
        </p>

        <p>
        <i>TARGET</i> is the cm3 target.
        </p>

        <p>
        You can download a minimal binary installation archive <a href="download.html">here</a>.
        </p>

      <h3>CM3 source packages</h3>

      <p>
        As mentioned above, you also need the CM3 source code
        to install CM3. Several source packages are available:
      </p>

    <blockquote><tt>cm3-src-all-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt></blockquote>
    <p>
        The <i>src-all</i> archive contains the full source code for the cm3
        distribution. Not all of this is needed to get a working
        installation. Contains experimental packages that are
        not compiled and installed by default, and may even be
        broken. 
        Includes everything included in other packages below.
        Most interesting for developers who want to extend
        and enhance the CM3 system, or fix broken packages.
    </p>

    <blockquote><tt>cm3-src-std-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt></blockquote>
    <p>
      The <i>src-std</i> archive contains source code for a pre-defined set
      of standard packages that will compile and work.
    </p>

    <blockquote><tt>cm3-sys-std-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt></blockquote>
    <p>
      The <i>sys-std</i> archive contains source code for the compiler, the
      linker and the debugger.
    </p>
    <p>
    To get a working cm3 installation, you need either the src-all
    archive or <b>both</b> the src-std and sys-std archives.
    You can download source archives <a href="download.html">here</a>.
      You can verify the integrity of the downloaded
      archives by using the checksums and md5 hashes provided 
      <a href="checksums.php3">here</a>.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Performing the installation</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Minimal binary installation</h3>
     <p>
     Once you have got the binary installation package, create a
     new temporary directory (for example, /tmp/cm3), change into it,
     and unpack the minimal binary installation archive.
     </p>
     
     <p>
     Use a command like this on UNIX-like systems:
    </p>
    <pre>
  gzip -c -d cm3-min-OSTYPE-TARGET-CM3VERSION.tgz | tar xf -
    </pre>
    <!-- ENOSUPP
    <p>On Windows, you can unpack the installation archive with most common
    archiver programs such as winzip or 7zip.</p>
    -->

    <p>
      You will get the installation program
      (<tt>cminstall(.exe)</tt>), a copyright notice, a system archive
      (<tt>system.tgz</tt>) with the 
      precompiled standard libraries <tt>m3core</tt> and <tt>libm3</tt>.
      You can place additional archives,
      e.g. the doc distribution (<tt>cm3-doc-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>) in
      the same directory.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The installion program helps you setting up your initial CM3 configuration
      and extracts <i>system.tgz</i>. Alas, it is not perfect, and be very
      confusing to use, especially for the first time. There are plans to
      improve the installer in a future release.
      </p>

      <p>
      Change into the directory where you unpacked the archive, and
      start the installer by running
    <pre>
  ./cminstall
    </pre>
      <!-- ENOSUPP
      on UNIX-like systems and
      <pre>
      cminstall.exe
      </pre>
      on Windows.
      -->
    Note that the installer is text-based. You will need to open
    a command-line window in order to use it.</p>

    <p>
    The installer will first ask you where you want to install CM3.
    The default installation prefix is <i>/usr/local/cm3</i>.
    </p>

    <p>Next, it will ask about the default editor. This question is present
    for historical reasons. It is related to
    the graphical CM3 IDE called <i>Reactor</i>, which is not
    yet included in CM3. It used to be distributed with the commercial CM3 releases
    made by Critical Mass Inc., and was removed from the Open Source distribution
    because of licensing issues. There are efforts to add the IDE again in a future release.
    For now, you can simply ignore this question and pick the default by hitting Enter.</p>

    <p>Next, it will ask about paths to various development tools and libaries.
    This is a very important part, since some packages in CM3 will not compile if
    these libraries cannot be found. Given the amount of targets cm3
    runs on and the differences between them, we cannot give concrete
    examples for every possible situation. You will have to find out
    how to install the required tools and libraries on your system yourself.</p>

    <p>However, I will elaborate a bit on what cminstall does when it
    asks a question, since this can be a bit confusing at first. The example
    output is based on the FreeBSD version, and may look slightly different
    on your system.</p>

    <p>Let's consider this question cminstall is asking:
    <pre>
    Where are the flex/bison libraries?
    looking for library file(s): libfl.a
    checking for library files in directory /usr/lib... found 
    checking for library files in directory /usr/local/lib... not found
    checking for library files in directory /usr/local/gnu/lib... not found
    checking for directory /usr/lib... found 

     1: /usr/lib
     Where are the flex/bison libraries? [/usr/lib](1 of 1)</pre>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As you can see, cminstall prints the name of the library file it
    is looking for, <i>libfl.a</i>.
    It then searches a couple of directories for this file, and
    reports whether it found it. The
    <i>found</i> and <i>not found</i> lines are the only indicators
    whether cminstall was successful.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this case, the file was only found in one directory.
    Hitting enter would use the default answer <i>/usr/lib</i>, which is displayed in
    square brackets, and continue with the installation.
    This is perfectly fine here, since the file has indeed been found in /usr/lib,
    as indicated by the line
    </p>
    <pre>
    checking for library files in directory /usr/lib... found 
    </pre>

    <p>However, if cminstall cannot find the file, it behaves
    like this:</p>

    <pre>
    Where are the flex/bison libraries?
    looking for library file(s): libfl.a
    checking for library files in directory /usr/lib... not found
    checking for library files in directory /usr/local/lib... not found
    checking for library files in directory /usr/local/gnu/lib... not found
    checking for directory /usr/lib... found 

    1: /usr/lib
    Where are the flex/bison libraries? [/usr/lib](1 of 1) 
    </pre>

    <p>As you can see, it still suggests <i>/usr/lib</i> as the default,
    even though the library was not found. Simply hitting enter now
    results in the following question:</p>
    <pre>
    The libraries libfl.a are not present in the chosen directory.
    Would you like to change the library names? [yes] 
    </pre>
    <p>Even though the default answer is <i>yes</i>, one would usually
    want to answer <i>no</i> here, and search the software packages available
    for the operating system for a package containing the needed library file.
    After installing the package, you can tell cminstall to try to find the
    library again by answering <i>no</i> to the next question:</p>
    <pre>
    Would you like to continue nonetheless? [yes]
    </pre>
    <p>If you answer <i>no</i> here, cminstall will try to find the library
    again. If you answer <i>yes</i> the default directory is entered into the
    configuration file and installation continues. If the library is not present in
    the chosen directory however, compiling
    the full cm3 installation will probably fail, so answering <i>yes</i>
    is usually not a really good idea (even though it is the default answer).</p>
    
    <p>
    If the installation fails for any reason, send mail to
    <a href="mailto:m3-support{at}elego.de">m3-support{at}elego.de</a>.
      As always, please include as much useful information
      as possible in your email, especially the log file written by
      cminstall, which resides in the installation prefix you chose,
      and of course hardware/operating system information.
    </p>

    <p>Now update your environment so that CM3 binaries and libraries can be
    found by the system.</p>
    <p>
    On UNIX-like systems, extend your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings so they include
    CM3 binaues and libraries. Here is an example for bourne shells:
    </p>
    <pre>
  export PATH="${PATH}:/usr/local/cm3/bin"
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cm3/lib"
  </pre>

    <!-- ENOSUPP
    <p>On Windows, you need to append the <i>bin</i> directory that resides
    in the cm3 installation prefix to the PATH environment
    variable in the system preferences.</p>
    -->


    <h3>Step 2: Bootstrapping the full CM3 installation</h3>

    <p>
    First, create a new directory for the source tree and unpack the source
    distribution archive(s) there. Here are example comamnds for UNIX-like systems:
    </p>
    <pre>
    mkdir cm3
    cd cm3
    gzip -c -d /path/to/cm3-src-XXX-CM3VERSION.tgz | tar xf -
    </pre>
   
   <p>
      Shell scripts in the 
      <tt>scripts/</tt> subdirectory of the source tree can be used to
      build and install (or &quot;ship&quot;) single packages or groups of packages.
      See the file <tt>scripts/README</tt> for details.
    </p>
    <p>We use one two scripts to bootstrap a full CM3 installation.</p>
  <pre>
  cd scripts
  ./do-cm3-core.sh buildship
  ./install-cm3-compiler.sh upgrade
  ./do-cm3-std.sh buildship
   </pre>
    <!-- ENOSUPP
   <p>
    The scripts directory also contains corresponding .cmd scripts that can
    be used on the Windows platform. Running the .sh scripts from within
    Cygwin also works.
    </p>
    -->

    <p>These steps take a while, especially the last one. When this is done,
    the installation is finished.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Upgrading CM3</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to upgrade to a new CM3 version, use the
      <tt>upgrade.sh</tt> script, and have a look at the <a
        href="upgrading.html">chapter about upgrading</a>.
    </p>
    <p>If you are using a pre-5.3 version of cm3, a fresh install is
    recommended instead of upgrading. But you can also try using the upgrade-5.3.sh script
    instead of the upgrade.sh script.
    </p>

    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
    <p>
      Please have a look at the
      <a href="known-problems.html">Known Problems Page</a>. If you
      encounter any problem or difficulty that isn't mentioned there,
      don't hesitate to contact <a

      report</a> (perferably with a working fix :-)
    </p>

    <!-- ENOSUPP

    <h1>Windows-specific Notes</h1>

    <p>
      CM3 (like any other currently available Modula-3 distribution)
      does not provide its own linker, as this is a standard system
      utility. Unfortunaltey, on WIN32 systems no linker is installed
      by default if you don't buy the Microsoft development tools.
      The NT386 target (which is the only one currently supported for the
      WIN32 platform) needs the Microsoft linker (and C compiler if
      you compile C sources) to be operable. It seems that the Borland
      linker (which is freely evailable) cannot be used without
      changes as it does not support the definition of entry
      points. This needs to be further investigated, though. Anybody
      who knows about other usable linkers or who gets M3 programs
      linked without the Microsoft tools, please let us know.
      The Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition which can be downloaded
      free of charge does <b>not</b> seem to work with CM3, unfortunately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anybody who would like to volunteer writing a linker for WIN32
      in Modula-3 would also be very welcome :-)
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to use the UNIX shell scripts provided in the scripts
      directory, you will also need a recent installation of the
      cygwin32 emulation environment, which is a good idea anyway,
      since it provides you with a more-or-less standard shell (bash)
      and an almost-POSIX programming environment. Cygwin32 has
      improved very much in recent years. It can be downloaded from <a
      href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a> and is
      easy to install. Future releases of CM3 5.1 may also feature a
      cygwin based build target as known from the PM3 distribution
      (NT386GNU).
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been told that recent versions of WinZip should be fine
      to unpack the gzipped tar archives of the distribution. However,
      there has been at least one report of failure and I haven't
      tried it myself, so I would recommend using the cygwin tools
      anyway. The cygwin environment mentionend above contains gnu tar
      and gzip that can be used to unpack the archive. As a last
      resort, here are some links to the (old versions of)
      <a href="win32-tools/gzip.exe" 
         type="application/octet-stream">gzip.exe</a>,
      <a href="win32-tools/tar.exe" 
         type="application/octet-stream">tar.exe</a>, and
      <a href="win32-tools/cygwin.dll" 
         type="application/octet-stream">cygwin.dll</a> that are also
      used by the binary installer itself. 
    </p>
