    <h2>CM3 Installation Notes</h2>

    <p>
      CM3 5.1 comes as a full source distribution contained in a file
      named 
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>cm3-src-all-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>,</blockquote>
    <p>
      a considerably smaller standard distribution
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>cm3-src-std-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>,</blockquote>
    <p>
      a (big) system archive containing the compiler, linker, and
      debugger sources for those who just want to work on the tools 
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>cm3-sys-std-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>,</blockquote>
    <p>
      and several minimal binary installation archives named
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>cm3-min-OSTYPE-TARGET-CM3VERSION.tgz</tt>.</blockquote>
    <p>
      The binary installation archives only contain the compiler,
      system support libraries (if needed), m3core, libm3, and the CM3
      installer. This should be everything for a minimal but still
      usable CM3 system. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You will need to download one of the binary installation
      archives suitable for your system, and any of the source
      archives you want. You can then use the minimal binary
      installation to build any of the packages contained in the
      source distributions. Some useful scripts have been added in the
      <tt>scripts</tt> subdirectory to help with the installation and
      package build management.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have got the binary installation package, unpack it using
      the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>
  gzip -c -d cm3-min-OSTYPE-TARGET-CM3VERSION.tgz | tar xf -
    </pre>
    <p>
      You will then get the installation program, a copyright notice,
      and the installation program. You can place additional archives,
      e.g. the doc distribution (cm3-doc-CM3VERSION.tgz) in the same
      directory. Start the installer with
    </p>
    <pre>
  ./cminstall
    </pre>
    <p>
      and answer all the questions. If the installation fails for any
      reason, send mail to <a
      href="mailto:m3-support@elego.de">m3-support@elego.de</a>. Keep in
      mind that this is still a pre-release and may not work as
      expected. As always, please include as much useful information
      as possible in your email, especially the log file written by
      cminstall and hardware/operating system information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If everything worked fine, extend your PATH and LD_LIBRARAY_PATH
      settings as needed, and unpack the source distribution
      archive(s) and install all the rest from source, for example
    </p>
    <pre>
  gzip -c -d cm3-src-XXX-CM3VERSION.tgz | tar xf -
  cd scripts
  PATH="${PATH}:/usr/local/cm3/bin"
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} /usr/local/cm3/lib"
  more README
  ./do-cm3-std.sh -help
  ./do-cm3-std.sh buildship
    </pre>

    <h2>Platform Notes</h2>

    <h3>WIN32</h3>

    <p>
      The NT386 target (which is the only one currently supported for the
      WIN32 platform) needs the Microsoft linker (and C compiler if
      you compile C sources) to be operable. It seems that the Borland
      linker (which is freely evailable) cannot be used without
      changes as it does not support the definition of entry
      points. This needs to be further investigated, though. Anybody
      who knows about other usable linkers or who gets M3 programs
      linked without the Microsoft tools should tell us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anybody who would like to volunteer writing a linker for WIN32
      in Modula-3 would also be vert welcome :-)
    </p>

    <h3>POSIX</h3>

    <p>
      This release (5.1.0) has been bootstrapped on FreeBSD3,
      LINUXLIBC6, and SOLgnu, where the majority of the supplied
      packages compiles. The newly ported compiler backend based on
      gcc 2.95.2 still seems to contains some minor problems, though,
      which need to be fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have made no attempt to compile m3gdb yet. My experience is
      that it will take at least a week. The current m3gdb which
      exists as a port on FreeBSD (and is based on a much later
      version) is partially usable; it fails on displaying of several
      types (TEXTs, WIDECHARs, etc.) which have been changed in CM3
      5.1. I haven't even investigated yet if someone at Critical Mass
      has made changes to m3gdb to make it work again with the new
      system. 
    </p>
