    <h2>CM3 5.1 and Elego ComPact</h2>

    <p>
      Instead of using the shell scripts provided in the
      <tt>script</tt> directory of the source distribution, you can
      use the project manager of 
      <a href="http://www.elego-software-solutions.com/elego-compact/">
        Elego ComPact</a> to build, ship, clean, and generally
      maintain the CM3 5.1 packages. Elego ComPact offers also a
      component based view of version control (with components being
      packages, projects, and configurations) built on top of
      CVS. <b>Elego ComPact <i>Free</i></b> (free non-commercial use)
      and <b>Elego ComPact <i>Demo</i></b> (expiring free evaluation)
      can be downloaded from  
      <a href="http://www.elego-software-solutions.com/">Elego's WWW
      site</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently Elego ComPact is not distributed as open source, but
      with the release of CM3 5.1 there may be a more tightly
      integrated version of the Elego ComPact project manager and the
      CM3 builder that we release under the DEC SRC copyright. If
      you're interested in this, please write us about it. Elego
      ComPact is written entirely in Modula-3.
    </p>

    <h3>How to compile CM3 5.1 with Elego ComPact</h3>

    <p>
      It's quite easy to use Elego ComPact together with the CM3 5.1
      distribution. These steps are necessary:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="#c1">Install Elego ComPact</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#c2">Define an appropriate package kind</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#c3">Setup an Elego ComPact project</a>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You may then
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="#c4">Compile and ship CM3 packages with Elego ComPact</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#c5">Version control your CM3 packages</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#c6">Apply arbitrary commands to one, several, or all
        packages</a> 
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="c1">Install Elego ComPact</a></h4>
    <p>
      Please refer to the installation instructions on 
      <a href="http://www.elego-software-solutions.com/download-info.php3">
        Elego's Download pages</a>. Basically you only need to get the
      executable programs for your platform, unpack them somewhere in
      your file system, and extend your PATH. It is probably a good
      idea to get the configuration and manual archives as well,
      though. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The program you're using for project management tasks is named
      <tt>prjm</tt>. You will get a short help notice with <tt>prjm
      -h</tt> and a more verbose description with <tt>prjm -man</tt>. 
      You can also use Elego ComPact's graphical user interface
      <tt>ComPactHTTPd</tt>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Try to run the programs and have a look at the in-line help. If
      you encounter any problems, feel free to contact <a
      href="mailto:compact@elego.de">compact@elego.de</a>. 
    </p>

    <h4><a name="c2">Define an appropriate package kind</a></h4>

    <p>
      The Elego ComPact tools need to be able to locate and identify
      your CM3 packages. As Elego ComPact is language independent, it
      needs some information about the structure of packages and the
      actions that may be applied to them. Here at Elego we currently
      use the following definitions:
    </p>
    <pre>
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CM3 5.1 System Packages on UNIX
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
pkgkind CRITICAL_MASS_M3_SYS_UNIX
  ostype "bsd|unix|linux|sunos5" has file "src/m3makefile" and dir "src"
  inherit actions BASIC_VC_UNIX_OVERRIDES
  inherit actions BASIC_VC
  inherit actions CRITICAL_MASS_M3_SYS

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CM3 5.1 System Packages on Win32
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
pkgkind CRITICAL_MASS_M3_SYS_WIN32
  ostype "winnt|windows|win32|nt|cygwin" has file "src/m3makefile" and dir "src"
  inherit actions CRITICAL_MASS_M3_SYS

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CM3 5.1 System Packages
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
pkgkind CRITICAL_MASS_M3_SYS
  has file "src/m3makefile" and dir "src"
  inherit actions BASIC_VC
  action build 			"m3msh -- rm .bok &amp;&amp; cm3 {?OPT} {?CM3OPT} -build 2&gt; PkgErr &amp;&amp; m3msh -- touch .bok"
  action buildlocal		"m3msh -- rm .bok &amp;&amp; cm3 {?OPT} {?CM3OPT} -DROOT={!ROOT} -build -override &amp;&amp; m3msh -- touch .bok"
  action builtok 		"test -f .bok"
  action shipglobal		"cm3 {?OPT} {?CM3OPT} -ship 2&gt; PkgErr &amp;&amp; m3err PkgErr"
  action shipproject		"cm3 {?OPT} {?CM3OPT} -ship 2&gt; PkgErr &amp;&amp; m3err PkgErr"
  action shiplocal		"echo no shipping needed"
  action clean			"cm3 {?OPT} {?CM3OPT} -clean 2&gt; PkgErr &amp;&amp; m3err PkgErr"
  action realclean		"m3msh rm {?OPT} {?RMOPT}  PkgDep PkgCDT PkgCRT PkgErr ; cm3 {?OPT} {?CM3OPT} -clean"
  action mkdep			"m3dep {?OPT} {?M3DEPOPT} &gt; PkgDep &amp;&amp; test -f src/m3overrides || m3ovr -v {!LOCATIONS} &gt; src/m3overrides 2&gt; PkgErr"

    </pre>
    <p>
      These definitions extend the standard definitions bundled with
      Elego ComPact's programs. We suggest you put them into the file
      <tt>${HOME}/compact/PkgBase.DefaultData</tt>, which is one of
      the standard locations where ComPact will look for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      You could as well use the bundled definitions only, but by
      default the project manager will overwrite your
      <tt>m3overrides</tt> files with generated ones containing
      absolute paths from your workspace. This will make it difficult
      to provide patches (context diffs). So we suggest you use the
      above definitions and ensure that all the m3override files are
      correct, i.e. defining all necessary overrides relative to the
      variable <tt>ROOT</tt>. As the first source distribution of CM3
      did only contain some correct m3override files, you probably
      want to get the <a href="m3override-update.tgz"
      type="application/octet-stream">m3override-update.tgz</a> update
      archive. You will notice that the buildlocal action uses the
      variable <tt>ROOT</tt> which must be passed to <tt>prjm</tt> on
      the command line, e.g. <tt>prjm -D ROOT=~/work/cm3
      more-arguments</tt>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally you need to make sure that Elego ComPact correctly
      identifies your packages. You can do this by setting the
      environment variable <tt>PKGKIND=CRITICAL_MASS_M3_SYS_UNIX</tt>
      and exporting its value, or by placing a <tt>PkgKind</tt> file
      containing that name in every package root. This can easily be
      accomplished with one of the scripts in <tt>cm3/scripts</tt>:
    </p>
    <pre>
  ./pkgmap.sh -c 'echo CRITICAL_MASS_M3_SYS_UNIX &gt; PkgKind' `cat PKGS`
    </pre>

    <p>
      If the package database <tt>PKGS</tt> does not yet exist, you
      must create it with <tt>./find-packages</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's all that is needed for the general setup of Elego ComPact
      and CM3.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="c3">Setup an Elego ComPact project</a></h4>

    <p>
      To actually do something useful with the Elego ComPact tools,
      and CM3, you also need one or more <b>project
      descriptions</b>. These are packages that contain a <b>project
      description file (PrjDesc)</b>. A project description file that
      contains some CM3 standard packages looks like this
      (<tt>~/work/prjm/cm3-std/PrjDesc</tt>): 
    </p>
    <pre>

    </pre>

    <p>
      The <tt>PrjDesc</tt> file contains definitions of collections
      and packages and their location. In the file above, all package
      locations are relative to the environment variable
      <tt>PRJ_ROOT</tt>, which is convention at Elego. You could also
      directly insert the path to the root of your workspace there.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <tt>PrjDesc</tt> file must reside in the directory where
      <tt>prjm</tt> is invoked, which is then considered to be a
      project package. A project package is also used by <tt>prjm</tt>
      to save and reconstruct project configurations and version
      control the needed meta data. For build management purposes you
      need not concern yourself with these uses.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is probably easiest to get the <a href="cm3-elego-5.1.0.tgz">
        cm3-elego-5.1.0.tgz</a> archive which contains some example
      project files and the appropriate package kind definitions.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="c4">Compile and ship CM3 packages with Elego
        ComPact</a></h4> 

    <p>
      Once you have setup everything as described, you can easily
      compile an arbitrary big set of packages. We'll use the cm3-std
      project again as an example, which we assume is installed in
      your home directory under <tt>${HOME}/work/prjm/cm3-std</tt>:
    </p>

    <pre>
  PRJ_ROOT=${HOME}/work
  ROOT=${HOME}/work/cm3
  export ROOT PRJ_ROOT

  prjm -D ROOT=${ROOT} -buildlocal
    </pre>

    <p>
      The first three lines are just to remind you of the setup
      needed, while the last line will compile all packages in the
      <tt>PrjDesc</tt> file. The project manager will automatically
      determine the dependencies of the packages (as long as all the
      imports can be found in the top-level m3makefile) and issue all
      needed commands. It also uses a cache containing fingerprints of
      all the packages, so that only packages that have changed will
      be re-compiled. So the given command should usually find a quite
      minimal set of build commands.
    </p>

    <p>
  If you want to compile all the packages and ship them to the CM3
  package pool (usually in <tt>/usr/local/cm3/pkg</tt>), use the
  following command:
    </p>
    <pre>
  prjm -D ROOT=${ROOT} -buildglobal
    </pre>

    <h4><a name="c5">Version control your CM3 packages</a></h4>

    <p>
      If you have set up CVS and your packages are under version
      control, you can use the Elego ComPact package version manager
      <tt>pkgvm</tt> to checkout named versions of packages, commit
      changes, view diff listings, package logs, etc. And you can use
      the project manager <tt>prjm</tt> to apply version control on a
      project wide scale. Note: You <em>must</em> have checked out the
      packages from a CVS repository for this to work. Elego would
      like to provide public access to the CM3 CVS repository via CVS
      and CVSup, but this needs some time to organize and setup;
      anyway, it's not working yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's assume you have got a working CVS repository with all the
      versions of all the CM3 sources. You can then checkout an
      initial workspace populated with the latest versions with:
    </p>
    <pre>
  prjm -get head
    </pre>

    <p>
      If you have made some modifications, you may want to see what
      packages are modified and produce a unified context diff of all
      the changes:
    </p>

    <pre>
  prjm -mod
  prjm -m -q -qc -udiff
    </pre>

    <p>
      You could then commit all the changes and create a named change
      set at the same time:
    </p>

    <pre>
  prjm -m -cs my-change-set -commit patch
    </pre>

    <p>
      To remember the current configuration of your workspace under a
      simple name, you would make use of a snapshot:
    </p>

    <pre>
  prjm -snapshot my-snapshot-name
    </pre>

    <p>
      This configuration could then be restored using the <tt>-get</tt>
      command of the project manager at any time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are a lot of more version control functions you can use to
      control the history of your projects. We will not enumerate them
      here and be content with the given examples; please have a look
      at the complete 
      <a href="http://www.elego-software-solutions.com/man/index.html">
        Elego ComPact Manuals</a>.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="c6">Apply arbitrary commands to one, several, or all
        packages</a></h4>  

    <p>
      The Elego ComPact project manager is a tool which applies
      actions to a set of packages. Some actions are pre-defined, but
      you may as well apply any other command to one, some, or all
      packages of a project. 
    </p>

    <pre>
  prjm -apply 'wc src/*.i3 src/*.m3'
    </pre>

    <p>
      will give you the character, word, and line number of the m3
      files in the <tt>src</tt> directory of your packages. You could
      as well search for something or replace certain expressions
      using some standard POSIX tools:
    </p>

    <pre>
  prjm -k -apply 'test -f src/m3overrides && 
       mv src/m3overrides src/m3overrides.bak && 
       sed -e 's/ROOT/TOP/g' src/m3overrides.bak &gt; src/m3overrides'
    </pre>

    <p>
      This would change all the ROOT variables in the override files
      to TOP. The Elego ComPact command line tools fit nicely in the
      old paradigm of small tools that can be combined in various
      ways. 
    </p>
