    <h2>Booting CM3 5.1 with PM3 or SRC M3</h2>

    <p>
      The CM3 5.1 compiler may be compiled with the PM3 Modula-3
      compiler or the older SRC version. As there have been changes in
      the standard libraries (Text interface) and the language
      (WIDECHARs), a bootstrapping process is necessary. This
      bootstrapping contains the following steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Apply the <a href="m3-boot-diffs">m3-boot-diffs</a> using the
        popular patch program to the cm3/m3-sys directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure that the compiler contains the necessary platform
        support. Inspect the following files:<br>
        <tt>cm3/m3-sys/m3middle/src/Target.m3</tt><br>
        <tt>cm3/m3-sys/cm3/config/${TARGET}</tt><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Compile and link the CM3 compiler using the libraries of the
        PM3 system. You can do this with the the script
        <tt>cm3/scripts/boot-cm3-with-m3.sh</tt>. Have a look at the
        script to see what packages are needed if you prefer to do it
        without shell's help.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up a CM3 directory skeleton (usually at
        /usr/local/cm3). You can use the script
        <tt>cm3/scripts/create-skel.sh</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Install the compiler frontend (cm3), backend (cm3g)(if
        needed), and mklib (if needed) in the recently created cm3/bin
        directory, along with the appropriate platform config file
        (<tt>cm3/m3-sys/cm3/config/${TARGET} --&gt;
        /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3.cfg</tt>). 
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully check all the settings in your configuration file
        <tt>cm3.cfg</tt> 
      </li>
      <li>
        Extend your <tt>PATH</tt> to contain the CM3 bin directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reverse the applied patches or just unpack the original
        cm3/m3-sys sources.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compile the standard libraries <tt>m3core</tt> and
        <tt>libm3</tt> using the new compiler. Make sure that all the
        platform support stuff in m3core (various ${TARGET}
        subdirectories) and the Unix interfaces (if needed) are
        up-to-date. Ship the standard libraries using the new
        compiler. You can use the script
        <tt>cm3/scripts/do-cm3-min.sh</tt>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Recompile the CM3 compiler using the new CM3 compiler. Install
        the resulting cm3 executable as before, but make sure not to
        remove the first version just in case anything went wrong. You
        can again use the <tt>cm3/scripts/boot-cm3-with-m3.sh</tt>
        script.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recompile the standard libraries again and ship them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recompile the CM3 compiler again and link it against the
        latest standard libraries. Install the cm3 executable as
        before. The booting process should now have reached a
        fix-point. 
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If the platform for which you want to bring up the CM3 compiler
      hasn't been tested yet (anything except NT386, FreeBSD3, SOLgnu,
      and LINUXLIBC6), you may experience problems due to incompatible
      system interfaces and two years old runtime support. If the
      platform is contained in PM3, you may be able to compare all the
      modules and borrow patches and things needed. Be aware that it
      will probably not do to copy the complete PM3 runtime stuff, as
      CM3 and PM3 have made different and sometimes incompatible
      extensions to the SRC compiler. Feel free request help at <a
      href="mailto:m3-support@elego.de">m3-support@elego.de</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The above procedure has been successfully applied to boot the
      CM3 5.1 source release on NT386, FreeBSD3, SOLgnu, and
      LINUXLIBC6, so it is unlikely to be completely wrong. Your
      mileage may wary though.
    </p>
