    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Please always get the archives with the latest
      patch levels. Older archives and updates may be referenced in
      these pages for the convenience of people who downloaded (large)
      packages some time ago (or simply for hysterical reasons :-),
      but are not recommended for a fresh installation.

      <b>Note:</b> Please verify the integrity of the downloaded

      You will need one of the binary archives to get a working
      compiler and one or more of the source distributions below. See
      the <a href="installation.html">installation notes</a> for
      further information.
    </p>

    <h3>Source Archives</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="cm3-src-all-5.1.3.tgz"
      type="application/octet-stream">cm3-src-all-5.1.3.tgz</a><br> 
      This archive contains the complete source code. It is rather big
      (&gt; 25MB).
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="cm3-src-sys-5.1.3.tgz"
      type="application/octet-stream">cm3-src-sys-5.1.3.tgz</a><br> 
      This archive contains all the system and tool source code as
      well as the standard libraries m3core and libm3. It is also
      rather big except the gnu tools (packages m3cc and m3gdb).
      (&gt; 7.5MB)
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="cm3-src-gnu-5.1.3.tgz"
      type="application/octet-stream">cm3-src-gnu-5.1.3.tgz</a><br> 
      This archive contains the gnu tools (packages m3cc and m3gdb).
      m3cc is the compiler backend for all POSIX platforms; m3gdb is
      the accompanying compiler. The included version of m3gdb is
      based on gdb 4.16 and currently not known to build on any
      platform. The included gcc is based on gcc 2.95.2. (&gt; 25MB)
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="cm3-src-std-5.1.4.tgz"
      type="application/octet-stream">cm3-src-std-5.1.4.tgz</a><br> 
      This archive contains a set of 
      <a href="cm3-src-std-contents.html">standard packages</a>
      (libraries and tools) that are currently compilable and form a
      useful system including network communication and graphical user
      interface (Trestle, FormsVBT). It is not as big as the other
      archives (about 5 MB :-). The packages contained can be built
      with <tt>scripts/do-cm3-std.sh</tt>. <b>This is the recommended
      choice for a standard CM3 installation.</b> Here is a <a
      href="cm3-src-std-contents.html">short list of contents</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="cm3-doc-5.1.3.tgz"
      type="application/octet-stream">cm3-doc-5.1.3.tgz</a><br> 
      This archive contains documentation for CM3 5.1 in HTML and PDF
      format, including CM3 help, tutorials, generated HTML
      documentation for all standard packages, and some DEC SRC
      research reports. Currently missing are the Reactor docs (as
      Reactor is not available) and the examples (which need much
      work). 
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="cm3-cvs-2001-04-07.tar.bz2"
         type="application/octet-stream">cm3-cvs-2001-04-07.tar.bz2</a><br>
      This is a snapshot of the complete CVS repository used to
      produce these releases. Note that it is compressed with bzip2,
      but is still very large (&gt; 28MB). You do not need this unless
      you want to have a look at the development history or plan to
      setup your own CM3 project. It may also be useful for someone
      working on the gcc backend stuff, as it contains three different
      cm3cg code generators based on gcc 2.7.2.1, cygnus-2.7.2-960712,
      and gcc 2.95.2.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="cm3-scripts-2001-04-08.tgz"
         type="application/octet-stream">cm3-scripts-2001-04-08.tgz</a><br>
      This is a version of the scripts from Elego at the given
      date. It is probably newer than the one contained in the source
      archives. 
    </p>

    <h3>Updates</h3>

    <h4>Release 5.1.0</h4>

    <p>
      <a href="m3override-update.tgz"
         type="application/octet-stream">m3override-update.tgz</a><br>
      This file contains fixed m3overrides files with complete
      overrides for all packages (except some test packages which have
      not yet been fixed) relative to <tt>ROOT</tt>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="src-update-2001-02-19.tgz"
         type="application/octet-stream">src-update-2001-02-19.tgz</a><br>
      Some files that were accidentally missing in the other source
      archives or have changed since their creation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="src-update-2001-02-21.tgz"
         type="application/octet-stream">src-update-2001-02-21.tgz</a><br>
      All the LINUXLIBC6 stuff has also been accidentally left out of
      the other source archive. Just unpack this archive in the
      top-level cm3 directory to get LINUXLIBC6 support.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="src-update-2001-02-24.tgz"
         type="application/octet-stream">src-update-2001-02-24.tgz</a><br>
      This update provides a working and much easier-to-use <tt>m3tohtml</tt>
      tool which can be used to create HTML documents from CM3
      packages as well as some fixes to make the <tt>db</tt> and
      <tt>odbc</tt> packages compile (at least on FreeBSD). The db
      packages have not yet been tested, though.  
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="src-update-2001-03-01.tgz"
         type="application/octet-stream">src-update-2001-03-01.tgz</a><br>
      Updates and fixes for packages cm3, cminstall, postgres95,
      smalldb, and scripts.
    </p>

    <p>
      All packages with version number 5.1.1 contain the updates prior
      to 2001-03-01.
    </p>

    <h4>Release 5.1.1</h4>

      <a href="cminstall.exe.gz"
         type="application/octet-stream">cminstall.exe.gz</a><br>
      A new binary installer for WIN32 which mangles pathnames with
      spaces into their 8.3 equivalent. (Though experimental, this has
      been included in all releases after 5.1.1.)
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="src-update-2001-03-11.tgz"
         type="application/octet-stream">src-update-2001-03-11.tgz</a><br>
      Updates and fixes for packages cm3 (minimal profiling support
      for some POSIX systems), cminstall (win32 improvements), libm3
      (changed ProcessWin32 module), m3core (FreeBSD4 dtoa fix),
      scripts, and CMASS copyright texts.
    </p>


    <h4>Release 5.1.3</h4>

    <p>
      <a href="src-update-2001-05-12.tgz"

      Fix for m3core/src/text/TextSub.m3, addition of Juno-2 packages,
      do-cm3-std.bat script (untested), several minor script fixes and
      improvements. New version number is 5.1.4.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="src-update-2001-09-19.tgz"
         type="application/octet-stream">src-update-2001-09-19.tgz</a><br>

      (mostly typos and missing overrides etc.), and addition of the
      caltech-parser distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="cm3-scripts-2001-09-19.tgz"
         type="application/octet-stream">cm3-scripts-2001-09-19.tgz</a><br>
