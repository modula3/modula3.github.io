    <h4>1.1 Linkage failure: cannot find -lXaw</h4>
    </a>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> mostly LINUXLIBC6, LINUXELF
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      Problems of this kind will arise if the linker cannot find the
      static standard libraries of the X systems. This will mostly be
      a problem on Linux systems, as almost all newer distributions
      tend to not install static libraries by default. A typical
      failure situation looks like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
&gt; === package /home/i8fs1/VERIF/usr/old/stow/cm3/current/m3-ui/formsedit ===
&gt;  +++ cm3 -build -override -DROOT=/home/i8fs1/VERIF/usr/old/stow/cm3/current  +++
&gt; --- building in LINUXLIBC6 ---
&gt; /home/i8fs1/VERIF/usr/old/stow/cm3/tmp/bin/m3bundle -name formseditBundle -F/tmp/qk
&gt; new source -&gt; compiling FormsEditVBT.i3
&gt; new source -&gt; compiling formseditBundle.i3
&gt; new source -&gt; compiling FormsEditVBT.m3
&gt; new source -&gt; compiling FormsEdit.m3
&gt; new source -&gt; compiling formseditBundle.m3
&gt;  -&gt; linking formsedit
&gt; /home/i8fs1/VERIF/usr/old/bin/ld: cannot find -lXaw
&gt; collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
    </pre>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      Usually it is possible to install the missing libraries without
      much effort.
    </p>

    <a name="p_1_2">
    <h4>1.2 Filenames with spaces</h4>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> all, especially WIN32
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      CM3 currently cannot handle filenames containing spaces very
      well. This will probably not be an issue on POSIX platforms, but
      it is very annoying on WIN32, as many standard installation path
      names contain spaces there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem cannot be easily resolved. This is due to the broken
      process creation interface on WIN32 platforms, which does not
      allow transparent passing of parameters, and some standard
      <tt>quake</tt> functions, which have to be replaced by more
      general equivalents, like <tt>exec, arglist</tt> (probably more).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      There is no easy solution to this problem. As a temporary
      workaround, the installer has been modified to replace pathnames
      with spaces by their 8.3 style equivalent on WIN32. If you
      cannot avoid using spaces in your CM3 projects, the 8.3 style
      short form should be a possible though ugly workaround for that,
      too. Voluntary contributions in this area are more than welcome.
      This workaround is incorporated in all installation programs
      since release 5.1.1.

    <h4>
      1.3 Linker trouble with latest Microsoft VC++
      compilers on WIN32 platform
    </h4>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> WIN32/NT386, reproduced with Microsoft 32-Bit
      C/C++-Compiler, Version 12.00.8804, non-issue with 32-bit C/C++
      Standard Compiler Version 10.00.6002 for 80x86 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      Building of dynamic libraries (DLLs) (e.g. for m3core) fails
      with unresolvable ambiguous symbols __real@8@... It turns out
      that during the compilation of C sources the compiler defines an
      8 bytes data section for every floating point constant (which is
      fine) and marks it as exported (which is certainly
      unexpected). The library archiver <tt>mklib</tt> shortens these
      symbols after the first @ character and leaves the linker with
      lots of equally named constants. It is still unclear to me why
      the compiler behaves in this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b>
      There has been one report where more linker errors have been
      encountered (in libm3), though the work-around mentioned below
      had been applied. So it may well be that there are still
      undiscovered problems and unknown incompatibilities with
      particular releases of the Microsoft tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      No real solution is known, as I haven't found a way to make the
      compiler not export the floating point constants. Older
      compilers (see above) do not exhibit this
      behaviour. Unfortunately, it is neither possible (as has been
      suggested) to (a) not to shorten the symbols after the @ character,
      and (b) ignore the export of all symbols beginning with two
      underscores while writing the linker .def file (this even fails
      for libm3). In CM3 5.1.3 a workaround has been implemented,
      which cures the problem for all tested m3 packages; this is
      still no general solution, though, as it may break other
      existing code. The <tt>mklib</tt> program has been extended by
      a switch to ignore certain exported symbols: <tt>-ign:XXX</tt>
      instructs the archiver to ignore all symbols beginning with
      XXX. The option <tt>-ign:__real</tt> has been added to the
      templates for the global configuration file <tt>cm3.cfg</tt>.

    <h4>
      1.4 Assembler problem on LINUXLIBC6 (filds 
        instrcution)
    </h4>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> reported for LINUXLIBC6, possibly other POSIX
      platforms, too
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      The assembler reports errors due to an unknown i386 instruction
      like this:
      <pre>
  new source -> compiling RealFloatExtras.m3
  RealFloatExtras.ms: Assembler messages:
  RealFloatExtras.ms:69: Error: no such 386 instruction: `filds'
  RealFloatExtras.ms:153: Error: no such 386 instruction: `filds'
  RealFloatExtras.ms:209: Error: no such 386 instruction: `filds'
  new source -> compiling LongFloatExtras.i3
  new source -> compiling LongFloatExtras.m3
  LongFloatExtras.ms: Assembler messages:
  LongFloatExtras.ms:69: Error: no such 386 instruction: `filds'
  LongFloatExtras.ms:154: Error: no such 386 instruction: `filds'
  LongFloatExtras.ms:211: Error: no such 386 instruction: `filds'
      </pre>
      The above was observed on a RedHat 6.1 Linux system with libc6
      and gcc 2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2). 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      I've currently no information about the excat version of GNU
      tools that cause the problem, which obviously seems to be a
      compiler/assembler version mismatch. I would expect that
      upgrading the assembler to a more recent version should solve
      the problem, but haven't asserted this yet, nor do can I name
      the version that is needed. More information from people working
      on (RedHat) Linux systems would be welcome.

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> NT386

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      The installation program cannot unpack the system and other
      archives because <tt>cygwin.dll</tt>, which is needed by the

      Either
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        place a working <tt>cygwin.dll</tt> in next to the
        <tt>cminstall</tt> program,

      <li>
        place a working <tt>tar.exe</tt> next to the

      <li>
        get a newer installation archive (5.1.1 or better).
