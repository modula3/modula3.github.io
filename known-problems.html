    <h4>1.1 Linkage failure: cannot find -lXaw</h4>
    </a>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> mostly LINUXLIBC6, LINUXELF
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      Problems of this kind will arise if the linker cannot find the
      static standard libraries of the X systems. This will mostly be
      a problem on Linux systems, as almost all newer distributions
      tend to not install static libraries by default. A typical
      failure situation looks like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
&gt; === package /home/i8fs1/VERIF/usr/old/stow/cm3/current/m3-ui/formsedit ===
&gt;  +++ cm3 -build -override -DROOT=/home/i8fs1/VERIF/usr/old/stow/cm3/current  +++

&gt; collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
    </pre>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      Usually it is possible to install the missing libraries without
      much effort.
    </p>

    <h4>1.2 Filenames with spaces</h4>
    </a>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> all, especially WIN32
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      CM3 currently cannot handle filenames containing spaces very
      well. This will probably not be an issue on POSIX platforms, but
      it is very annoying on WIN32, as many standard installation path
      names contain spaces there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem cannot be easily resolved. This is due to the broken
      process creation interface on WIN32 platforms, which does not
      allow transparent passing of parameters, and some standard
      <tt>quake</tt> functions, which have to be replaced by more
      general equivalents, like <tt>exec, arglist</tt> (probably more).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      There is no easy solution to this problem. As a temporary
      work-around, the installer has been modified to replace pathnames
      with spaces by their 8.3 style equivalent on WIN32. If you
      cannot avoid using spaces in your CM3 projects, the 8.3 style
      short form should be a possible though ugly work-around for that,
      too. Voluntary contributions in this area are more than welcome.
      This work-around is incorporated in all installation programs
      since release 5.1.1.

    <h4>
      1.3 Linker trouble with latest Microsoft VC++
      compilers on WIN32 platform
    </h4>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> WIN32/NT386, reproduced with Microsoft 32-Bit
      C/C++-Compiler, Version 12.00.8804, non-issue with 32-bit C/C++
      Standard Compiler Version 10.00.6002 for 80x86 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      Building of dynamic libraries (DLLs) (e.g. for m3core) fails
      with unresolvable ambiguous symbols __real@8@... It turns out
      that during the compilation of C sources the compiler defines an
      8 bytes data section for every floating point constant (which is
      fine) and marks it as exported (which is certainly
      unexpected). The library archiver <tt>mklib</tt> shortens these
      symbols after the first @ character and leaves the linker with
      lots of equally named constants. It is still unclear to me why
      the compiler behaves in this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b>
      There has been one report where more linker errors have been
      encountered (in libm3), though the work-around mentioned below
      had been applied. So it may well be that there are still
      undiscovered problems and unknown incompatibilities with
      particular releases of the Microsoft tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      No real solution is known, as I haven't found a way to make the
      compiler not export the floating point constants. Older
      compilers (see above) do not exhibit this
      behaviour. Unfortunately, it is neither possible (as has been
      suggested) to (a) not to shorten the symbols after the @ character,
      and (b) ignore the export of all symbols beginning with two
      underscores while writing the linker .def file (this even fails
      for libm3). In CM3 5.1.3 a work-around has been implemented,
      which cures the problem for all tested m3 packages; this is
      still no general solution, though, as it may break other
      existing code. The <tt>mklib</tt> program has been extended by
      a switch to ignore certain exported symbols: <tt>-ign:XXX</tt>
      instructs the archiver to ignore all symbols beginning with
      XXX. The option <tt>-ign:__real</tt> has been added to the
      templates for the global configuration file <tt>cm3.cfg</tt>.

      1.4 Assembler problem on LINUXLIBC6 (filds 
        instrcution)
    </h4>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> reported for LINUXLIBC6, possibly other POSIX
      platforms, too
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      The assembler reports errors due to an unknown i386 instruction
      like this:
      <pre>
  new source -> compiling RealFloatExtras.m3
  RealFloatExtras.ms: Assembler messages:
  RealFloatExtras.ms:69: Error: no such 386 instruction: `filds'

  LongFloatExtras.ms:211: Error: no such 386 instruction: `filds'
      </pre>
      The above was observed on a RedHat 6.1 Linux system with libc6
      and gcc 2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2). 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      I've currently no information about the excat version of GNU
      tools that cause the problem, which obviously seems to be a
      compiler/assembler version mismatch. I would expect that
      upgrading the assembler to a more recent version should solve
      the problem, but haven't asserted this yet, nor do can I name
      the version that is needed. More information from people working
      on (RedHat) Linux systems would be welcome.

      1.5 Version stamp mismatch during upgrading
    </h4>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> all
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      The compiler reports version stamp mismatches in libm3
      like this:
      <pre>
 new source -> compiling ProcessPosix.m3
 new source -> compiling SocketPosix.m3

 Fatal Error: bad version stamps: SocketPosix.m3

   <4d31a453f94cbb46> => SocketPosix.m3 
    => Compiler.i3 
  *** execution of  failed ***</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      This only occurs on rare occasions when new target platforms
      have been added to the compiler. The solution is to first build
      a compiler who knows about the news platforms with the existing
      m3core and libm3 packages, and then build everything again. For

      4.1 Linkage failure: missing -L before library paths (installer bug)
    </h4>
    </a>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> all
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      The compiler complains about non-existant library files when
      trying to link with libraries that were not present at
      installation time but have been installed later. This is due to
      a bug in the installation program <tt>cminstall</tt> which
      forgets to prepend the string "-L" to all library paths for
      libraries that haven't actually been found by it. Thus the
      system library definitions in the configuration file
      <tt>cm3.cfg</tt> used by the system linker are sometimes
      incorrect.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      Add the missing -L to all system library definitions in
      <tt>cm3.cfg</tt> where it is missing. For example, the
      corresponding section in a FreeBSD4 configuration file (located
      at <tt>/usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3.cfg</tt> by default) might look
      like this (with all library path options added):

  "LIBC"       : [ "-lm" ],
  "LEX-YACC"   : [ "-L/usr/lib", "-ll" ],

  "POSTGRES95" : [ "-L/usr/local/pgsql/lib", "-lpq" ],
  "OPENGL"     : [ "-L/usr/X11R6/lib", "-lGLU", "-lGL", "-lXext" ],
  "MOTIF"      : [ "-L/usr/X11R6/lib", "-lXm" ],

      4.2 [Release 5.1.8] Linkage failure on POSIX platforms due to

          archives
    </h4> 
    </a>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> all POSIX platforms
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b> The isolation of the garbage collection
      support from <tt>m3core</tt> has lead to one unexpected problem
      in the preparation of the minimal binary installation
      archives. On all POSIX platforms, <tt>m3core</tt> now depends on
      either <tt>m3gc-simple</tt> or <tt>m3gc-enhanced</tt>. As
      <tt>m3core</tt> cannot <em>import</em> another Modula-3 library
      (due to subtleties of the runtime implementation), these
      libraries only contain some C source code files and are shipped
      explicitly to the installation root (<tt>INSTALL_ROOT</tt> in
      <tt>cm3.cfg</tt>). The used declaration for this export
      (<tt>LibdExport(libname)</tt>) creates an import directive like
      the following one in all <tt>.M3EXPORTS</tt> files of packages
      depending on it:
    </p>
    <pre>
  _import_otherlib("m3gcdefs", "/pub/lang/m3/cm3-dist/cm3/lib", IMPORTED)
    </pre>
    <p>
      This directive contains the absolute path (<tt>LIB_INSTALL</tt>)
      of the library in question. As the binary installation archives
      are always produced in an empty staging area
      (for example <tt>/pub/lang/m3/cm3-dist/cm3</tt>), this path is
      unlikely to be correct for the actual installation (where it
      should be <tt>/usr/local/cm3/lib</tt> by default).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      There are several possible solutions for this problem. We assume
      that <tt>INSTALL_ROOT</tt> is <tt>/usr/local/cm3</tt> and
      <tt>TARGET</tt> is the POSIX platform in use (FreeBSD4,
      LINUXLIBC6, etc.).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        After the installation of the minimal binary cm3 5.1.8
        distribution, edit the files
        <blockquote>
          <tt>/usr/local/cm3/pkg/m3core/TARGET/.M3EXPORTS</tt>
          <tt>/usr/local/cm3/pkg/libm3/TARGET/.M3EXPORTS</tt>
        </blockquote>
        and replace the line
        <blockquote>
          <tt>_import_otherlib("m3gcdefs", "/pub/lang/m3/cm3-dist/cm3/lib", IMPORTED)</tt>
        </blockquote>
        by either
        <blockquote>
          <tt>_import_otherlib("m3gcdefs", "/usr/local/cm3/lib", IMPORTED)</tt>
        </blockquote>
        or
        <blockquote>
          <tt>_import_otherlib("m3gcdefs", LIB_USE, IMPORTED)</tt>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        After the installation of the minimal binary cm3 5.1.8
        distribution, build and ship the packages <tt>m3core</tt> and
        <tt>libm3</tt> from one of the source distribution archives
        (e.g. <tt>cm3-src-std-5.1.8.tgz</tt>). You can do this with
        the following commands (<tt>WORK</tt> identifying your working
        area where you unpacked the sources):
        <pre>
  cd WORK/cm3/scripts
  ./do-pkg buildship m3core
  ./do-pkg buildship libm3
        </pre>
        This will put the correct paths in the <tt>.M3EXPORTS</tt>
        files.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use <tt>sed</tt> or <tt>perl</tt> to perform the needed
        substitutions as described in (1).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Future distributions (release &gt; 5.1.8) will avoid this
      problem by either modifying the export/import-mechanism for
      <tt>m3gc-simple</tt> and <tt>m3gc-enhanced</tt>, adjust the
      absolute paths during the construction of the binary
      distribution archive, or automatically adjust the abolsute paths
      after installation.

      5.1 Problems building the core distribution
      with Apple's gcc
    </h4>
    </a>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> PPC_DARWIN
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      The first problem is that Apple's gcc will produce the two
      non-relocatable symbols saveSP and restFP when compiling
      setjmp/longjmp calls; this will make the building of a dynamic
      library for m3core fail. The work-around is to use an assembler
      source RTThredC.s instead of RTThreadC.c that does not refer to
      these routines and explicitly saves and restores the floating
      point registers.

    <p>
      For the explanation of the second problem I just append the
      mail I've to interested parties:

    <p>
      --- start of quote ---<br>
      After your failure reports for compilation of the
      cm3/m3-sys/m3cc package (the gcc 3.2.1 based code generator) I
      made some tests myself and found that I had obviously again used
      my own gcc to build this package.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've made two or three attempts to get the package compile with
      Apple's native gcc (3.1 prerelease), but failed too. If nobody
      else finds a smart configuration hack I'm afraid that one will
      need a bootstrapped gcc 3.2.1 C compiler to compile the cm3cg
      code generator. This is annoying as it adds another big
      dependency for cm3 on Darwin; but it is not as big a problem as
      it might seem for two reasons:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        It was relatively easy for me to bootstrap gcc 3.2.1 on Darwin
        6.3 using the standard procedure; I only had to manually
        change the order of some definitions in one `fixed' include
        file. So everybody who really wants to compile the cm3 code
        generator for her/himself should be able to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        You don't need to recompile the code generator at all if you
        use the binary installation package; if you want to rebuild
        all the core packages, just specify
        <pre>
            OMIT_GCC=yes ./do-cm3-core.sh buildship</pre>
        and it will leave the m3cc package out.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      I've added a warning that is issued when building m3cc on
      PPC_DARWIN; the patched m3cc package is tagged
      devel_m3cc_d3_1_5.
    </p>

    <p>
      If anybody finds a way to avoid this bootstrap dependency and use
      Apple's native compiler to build m3cc, I'd be very interested.<br>

      As noted above, the 5.2.0 sources do not contain these changes; to get
      them, please use either anonymous CVS, CVSup, or the selective package
      download with appropriate arguments. You'll find all these on the
      M3 download page at http://modula3.elegosoft.com/ .

      <b>Solution:</b>
      The correct fix seems to be to add <tt>-lcc_dynamic</tt> when
      linking dynamic libraries. Thank you to Ben Hines for this
      hint. I've changed the configuration files for PPC_DARWIN in
      packages cm3 and cminstall and created new versions
      devel_cm3_d2_0_4 and devel_cminstall_d0_7_2. These fixes are
      included in <b>CM3 5.2.4</b>.

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      Do not compile m3gc-enhanced on PPC_DARWIN. It won't work as the
      virtual memory system and several system interfaces are too
      different from FreeBSD, from which the code was initially
      copied. m3gc-enhanced and some m3core modules would need a
      certain amount of work to become useful and allow generational
      and incremental garbage collection on PPC_DARWIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a switch -- <tt>M3GC_SIMPLE=yes</tt> -- which forces
      compilation of m3gc-simple only and omitting m3gc-enhanced. You
      use it like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      M3GC_SIMPLES=yes ./scripts/do-cm3-core.sh buildlocal</pre>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, due to an oversight this switch has not been
      activated by default for PPC_DARWIN in release 5.2.4, but
      shortly after. So if you get a version of the scripts dated
      after the 5.2.4 release, you won't need to specify
      <tt>M3GC_SIMPLES=yes</tt> in your environment.

      5.3 Problems with efficient exception handling (`stack walkers')
          and gcc 3.2.1
    </h4>
    </a>

    <p>
      <b>Platforms:</b> all (principally), SOLgnu
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b>
      Due to massive changes in gcc, since the upgrade of the code
      generator backend cm3cg to gcc 3.2.1, the implementation of stack
      walkers used for efficient exception handling on some platforms
      (in CM3 currently only SOLgnu, more are concerned in PM3) is
      broken. Here is an excerpt from an email by John Polstra
      concerned with this problem:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I have been looking at this today, and the news is not so good.
      I believe that the current M3 stack walking implementation
      _cannot_ work with modern GCCs.  The M3 implementation builds
      its own PC range tables.  It emits a label marking the start of
      a code region; then emits the code for the region; and then
      emits a label marking the end of the region.  And it relies on
      exactly that code remaining between the two labels.  But GCC now
      performs extensive flow analysis and code motion.  It will
      happily move code into or out of the region if it thinks that's
      a good idea.  There is not even a guarantee that the start label
      will appear before the end label in the generated code.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      The SET_LABEL operation in M3's intermediate language has a
      boolean "barrier" parameter which can be set to TRUE if code
      motion past the label must not take place, and the front end
      uses that to try to anchor these kinds of labels in place.  But
      that no longer works with modern GCC.  In fact, in my
      experiments the back end deleted the labels entirely.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      As far as I can tell, the only way to accomplish the above is to
      use GCC's built-in exception support.  There is a nice complete
      API for it -- see "gcc/except.h".  I think we would need to
      change the front end and the intermediate language to pass the
      higher-level language constructs (TRY...EXCEPT, TRY...FINALLY,
      etc.) all the way through to the back end.  Then GCC would
      generate the range tables and the code to use them itself.  It
      actually doesn't look very hard to do this, and I'm sure the
      resulting code would be better than it is now.  But I'm not
      volunteering at the moment. :-)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b>
      None at the moment. If you want to use the gcc 3.2.1-based
      backend for SOLgnu and other platforms with stack walkers, turn
      off this feature in
      <tt>cm3/m3-sys/m3middle/src/Target.m3</tt>. This will produce
      less efficient code for exception handling, but perhaps improve
      code performance in other aspects (untested).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hint:</b> We are still looking for volunteers to adapt the m3
      frontend to the new gcc exception interface :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fix:</b>The stack handler tables have been functional for some time
      now (since 2003/10/10) on targets that support it (SOLgnu/SOLsun,
      ALPHA_OSF).  As such, stack walkers have been turned on for these
      targets in their cm3 configuration files.  We still should look into
      adapting the m3 frontend use the gcc exception framework.

      6.3 Issues with /usr/bin/ld on Solaris

      <b>Platforms:</b> Solaris
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description:</b> 
        On Solaris, the 5.4 release likely needs to use the
        GNU ld linker. The GNU linker is expected to be  installed
        as <i>/usr/local/bin/ld</i>.
        This was done because there were issues
        with a configure script in the gcc sources of the cm3 compiler
        backend. It fails to detect linkers properly passed arguments
        in GNU linker conventions to the native Solaris linker, causing the
        compile to fail.
        The installation program lets you decide which linker to use
        for CM3 package builds, but you may run into problems if you
        do not use the GNU linker.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Solution:</b> Make sure that /usr/local/bin/ld is GNU ld.
