    <h3>Contributions and Acknowledgements</h3>

    <p>
      A lot of people have contributed to the original M3 release by
      DEC SRC, and the current code release is almost entirely the
      work of members of Critical Mass. I don't know all the names and
      cannot provide a list here. It would also not have been possible
      for me to setup this distribution without PM3 Modula-3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several people have contributed to this open source
      release of CM3 5.1 since the announcement of its availability
      for test. I hope I will be able to write up a page with their
      names some time around the official public release. Please don't
      be annoyed if you don't find your name mentioned here yet; I
      think it's better to concentrate on the software for some time.
    </p>

          <b>CM3 5.2.4</b> has been released. This is a maintenance
          release with several bug fixes and small extensions. Have a
          look at the <a href="RELNOTES_5_2_4">RELNOTES_5_2_4</a>
          for details.

          <b>CM3 5.2.0</b> has been released. It features a completely
          new code generation back-end based on gcc 3.2.1 and support
          for the new target platform PPC_DARWIN (Darwin, MacOS X on
          PowerPC). The new code generator has one flaw: it cannot
          work with the table based exception frame implementation of
          the current front end, so this needs to be re-done. As a
          consequence, the new back-end is not recommended for all
          target platforms supporting stack walkers. This release is
          made to make support for the new target platform available
          for everybody. See <a href="RELNOTES_5_2_0">RELNOTES_5_2_0</a>
          for details.

          The document archive has been updated. <a
          href="cm3-doc-5.1.8.tgz">cm3-doc-5.1.8.tgz</a> now contains
          all the current generated package documentation as of
          2002-04-08. CM3 now also includes <em>m3browser</em>, the
          well-known HTTP server that generates HTML documentation
          about installed packages on the fly, fully cross-referenced
          down to the type-level. <em>m3browser</em> has been imported
          from the PM3 distribution, together with the packages
          <em>m3scan</em> and <em>m3markup</em>, all of which reside
          in <em>m3-tools</em>. At the same time, some buffer
          implementations used in several packages have been extracted
          into their own library, <em>libbuf</em>. These changes are
          currently only available via CVS and CVSup.

          I've added another <a href="src-update-2002-04-02.tgz">5.1.8 
            fix archive</a> for those without CVSup and CVS
          ambitions. This archive contains all changed files since

          A bug in the binary installation archives of 5.1.8 for all
          POSIX platforms has been found. It is easy to fix,
          though. See 
          <a href="known-problems.html#p_4_2">
            4.2 [Release 5.1.8] Linkage failure on POSIX platforms due
                to wrong paths (/pub/lang/m3/cm3-dist) in binary
                installation archives
          </a> for details. As this can be easily corrected manually
          after the installation, no new distribution archives have
          been created.

          The master CVS repository for CM3 has been moved to
          www.elegosoft.com. This means that everybody who wants to
          work on the CM3 sources directly can get write access if he
          provides an ssh key (protocol version 2 (DSA)
          preferred). Send email to 
          <a href="mailto:m3-support@elego.de">m3-support@elego.de</a>
          if you are interested, and have a look at the <a

          missing -L before library paths (installer bug)</a> for
          details. As this can be easily corrected manually after the
          installation, no new distribution archives have been
          created.

          As always with new releases, some bugs appear right after
          creating the archives :-( Instead of building new release
          archives, I've created a <a href="src-update-2001-12-21.tgz">5.1.8 
            fix archive</a> for those without CVSup and CVS ambitions.

          CM3 5.1.8 has been released. New distribution archives have
          been placed on the servers for most of the active
          platforms. Changes include bug-fixes to the compiler
          (backend and quake interpreter), extraction of the system
          call wrappers from m3core into m3gc-enhanced, and addition of
          and fixes for lots of packages, concerning obliq, shared
          objects, graphics, and general useful libraries. A more
          detailed list of the changes can be found 
          <a href="cm3-5.1.8-details.txt">here</a>.

          Some new distribution archives have been placed on the server,
          including some fixes to the compiler and documentation. The
          current release number is now 5.1.6. Those who have installed
          5.1.3 or 5.1.4 should rather get the updates via CVSup or CVS
          than download the big distribution archives. Not all binary
          installation packages have been rebuilt and updated yet; a
          full build will probably be deferred until some of the more
          substantial changes currently in work are finished.

          has been added, which adds a fix for compilation of m3core on
          Linux systems using glibc 2.2, some minor package fixes, and
          the <a href="http://www.async.caltech.edu/~kp/parserlib/">parser

          Some progress has been made on improving the infrastructure
          of the cm3 source distribution: A <a href="cvsup-cm3.html">
            cm3 CVSup server</a> has been
          installed, and the cm3 repository is replicated once every
          night. As there are still unresolved issues with the domain
          registration for the machine the server is located on, it
          can currently only be contacted as
          ds217-115-141-112.dedicated.hosteurope.de or via IP number
          217.115.141.112. The CVSup server currently knows about the
          collections cm3, cm3-caltech-parser, cm3-doc, cm3-m3-comm,
          cm3-m3-db, cm3-m3-demo, cm3-m3-games, cm3-m3-lectern,
          cm3-m3-libs, cm3-m3-mail, cm3-m3-obliq, cm3-m3-pkgtools,
          cm3-m3-sys, cm3-m3-tools, cm3-m3-ui, cm3-m3-www,
          cm3-scripts, cm3-www. Anonymous CVS pserver access will be
          added soon, too.

             type="application/octet-stream">src-update-2001-05-12.tgz</a>
          has been added, which contains the differences between
          releases 5.1.3 and 5.1.4. These are: (1) A fix for
          m3core/src/text/TextSub.m3, (2) the addition of the <a
            href="http://www.research.compaq.com/SRC/juno-2/">Juno-2</a>
          packages, which contain a graphical constraint based editor,
          (3) a <tt>do-cm3-std.bat</tt> script (untested), and (4)
          several minor script fixes and improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.1.4 is also available as the source archive <a
            href="OUTDATED.html">cm3-src-std-5.1.4.tgz</a>,
          and as a binary installation archive for FreeBSD3. I haven't
          yet been able to build more distribution archives, but hope
          to get round to it next week. This should be no big problem,
          since everybody can easily use the update archive to upgrade
          his/her system.

          The first archives of the official CM3 5.1.3 release
          have been created. CM3 5.1.3 contains a work-around for the
          DLL creation / linker problem on NT386 (which actually seems
          to be a C compiler problem), a last-minute fix for dynamic
          linked executable on LINUXLIBC6, an almost completely fixed
          HTML documentation tree, and several minor fixes. The binary
          installation still supports only four platforms: NT386
          Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000 on x86), LINUXLIBC6 (Linux with
          glibc 2.1 on x86), FreeBSD3 (FreeBSD 3.X (4.X, 5.X?)) on
          x86, and Solaris (SunOS 5.6, 5.7, 5.8) on SPARC. On all
          these platforms dynamic linking and incremental and
          generational garbage collection is implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all archives are created and uploaded, some old stuff
          will be removed, cm3-unofficial will be renamed cm3, and an
          announcement will be posted to the m3 newsgroup.

          Several source and binary distributions have been upgraded
          to patch level 1 (cm3 5.1.1). This patch level includes all
          the fixes and extensions prior to 2001-03-01 (described
          below) plus the following recent changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            fixes for packages <tt>postgres95</tt> and
            <tt>smalldb</tt> (conditional compilation and win32
            extensions)
          </li>
          <li>
            cm3 now defines the quake variables <tt>CM3_VERSION</tt>,
            <tt>CM3_CREATED</tt>, and <tt>EOL</tt>. Based on these
            values, conditional compilation in m3makefiles should be
            easy. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The installer now looks for several other archives to
            unpack and installs them if found, including docs, fixes,
            and misc. On win32, the missing <tt>cygwin.dll</tt> for
            <tt>tar.exe</tt> has been added. 
          </li>
          <li>
            cm3 has a new option <tt>-depend</tt>, which writes a
            makefile dependency line containing the package
            dependencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            As usual, several scripts have been fixed ;-) and some new
            ones provided.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The TODO and package status lists have been updated. Some
          platform notes have been added on the installation page.

          The most important news is that now <b>documentation</b> is
          available for CM3 5.1. Much is still missing and not
          everything is up-to-date, but there is a complete set of
          documents for all standard packages and interfaces; the nice
          interfaces overview page from Critical Mass' Reactor
          distribution has been updated. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The <tt>m3tohtml</tt> program (which was broken due to several
          interface changes in the standard libraries) has been
          fixed. I have also added a user-friendlier frontend, some
          documentation (try `-h'), and made it more robust. It
          has been used to generate all the current package
          documentation in HTML, and you should also be able to use it
          for your own purposes without much effort.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Get the documentation archive from 
            <a href="OUTDATED.html">cm3-doc-5.1.0.tgz</a>.
          </li>
          <li>

            <a href="OUTDATED.html">cm3-scripts-2001-02-21.tgz</a>
