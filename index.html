    <h3>Contributions and Acknowledgements</h3>

    <p>
      A lot of people have contributed to the original M3 release by
      DEC SRC, and the current code release is almost entirely the
      work of members of Critical Mass. I don't know all the names and
      cannot provide a list here. It would also not have been possible
      for me to setup this distribution without PM3 Modula-3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several people have contributed to this open source
      release of CM3 5.1 since the announcement of its availability
      for test. I hope I will be able to write up a page with their
      names some time around the official public release. Please don't
      be annoyed if you don't find your name mentioned here yet; I
      think it's better to concentrate on the software for some time.
    </p>

          A simple build script for NT/Win2000 cmd shells has been
          added to the latest scripts archive. Some obsolete passages
          from the web pages have been removed, and some final
          adjustments before the official release have been made.
        </p>

          The first archives of the official CM3 5.1.3 release
          have been created. CM3 5.1.3 contains a work-around for the
          DLL creation / linker problem on NT386 (which actually seems
          to be a C compiler problem), a last-minute fix for dynamic
          linked executable on LINUXLIBC6, an almost completely fixed
          HTML documentation tree, and several minor fixes. The binary
          installation still supports only four platforms: NT386
          Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000 on x86), LINUXLIBC6 (Linux with
          glibc 2.1 on x86), FreeBSD3 (FreeBSD 3.X (4.X, 5.X?)) on
          x86, and Solaris (SunOS 5.6, 5.7, 5.8) on SPARC. On all
          these platforms dynamic linking and incremental and
          generational garbage collection is implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all archives are created and uploaded, some old stuff
          will be removed, cm3-unofficial will be renamed cm3, and an
          announcement will be posted to the m3 newsgroup.

          A chapter about
          <a href="about-cm3.html#if-changes">CM3 5.1 Interface Changes
            and Performance</a> has been added, as well as some
            updates to the TODO lists.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new source update archive 
          <!--<a href="src-update-2001-03-11.tgz"
             type="application/octet-stream">-->src-update-2001-03-11.tgz
          <!--</a>-->
          has also been created which contains the following latest
          changes:
          updates and fixes for packages cm3 (minimal profiling support
          for some POSIX systems), cminstall (win32 improvements), libm3
          (changed ProcessWin32 module), m3core (FreeBSD4 dtoa fix),
          scripts, and CMASS copyright texts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scripts archive has been updated, too.

        <p>
          Added a new installer for WIN32 which replaces filenames
          with spaces by their 8.3 equivalent.

          Several source and binary distributions have been upgraded
          to patch level 1 (cm3 5.1.1). This patch level includes all
          the fixes and extensions prior to 2001-03-01 (described
          below) plus the following recent changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            fixes for packages <tt>postgres95</tt> and
            <tt>smalldb</tt> (conditional compilation and win32
            extensions)
          </li>
          <li>
            cm3 now defines the quake variables <tt>CM3_VERSION</tt>,
            <tt>CM3_CREATED</tt>, and <tt>EOL</tt>. Based on these
            values, conditional compilation in m3makefiles should be
            easy. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The installer now looks for several other archives to
            unpack and installs them if found, including docs, fixes,
            and misc. On win32, the missing <tt>cygwin.dll</tt> for
            <tt>tar.exe</tt> has been added. 
          </li>
          <li>
            cm3 has a new option <tt>-depend</tt>, which writes a
            makefile dependency line containing the package
            dependencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            As usual, several scripts have been fixed ;-) and some new
            ones provided.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The TODO and package status lists have been updated. Some
          platform notes have been added on the installation page.
        </p>
        <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt>2001-03-01</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A problem report page has been added. Problem reports will be
          sent to the GNATS database at elego Software Solutions GmbH.
        </p>
        <p></p>

          The most important news is that now <b>documentation</b> is
          available for CM3 5.1. Much is still missing and not
          everything is up-to-date, but there is a complete set of
          documents for all standard packages and interfaces; the nice
          interfaces overview page from Critical Mass' Reactor
          distribution has been updated. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The <tt>m3tohtml</tt> program (which was broken due to several
          interface changes in the standard libraries) has been
          fixed. I have also added a user-friendlier frontend, some
          documentation (try `-h'), and made it more robust. It
          has been used to generate all the current package
          documentation in HTML, and you should also be able to use it
          for your own purposes without much effort.
