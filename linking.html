    <h1>How to configure linking with system libraries in CM3</h1>

    <p>This document explains how to configure linking
    Modula3 code with external libraries installed on your system.
    It is of interest to people who want to write Modula3 wrappers
    for libraries written in other programming languages, and
    to people who have problems with CM3 detecting libraries
    installed on their systems.</p>

    <h2>How CM3 links programs</h2>
    <p>
    When CM3 links an executable, it calls a
    function written in Quake that implements linking for
    the target. This function is called <i>m3_link()</i>.
    It is defined in the CM3 configuration file <i>cm3.cfg</i>, and
    can pull in system libraries if requested.
    </p>
   
    <p>The following is an example <i>m3_link()</i> implementation, taken from
    CM3 5.4 on FreeBSD. It is just here for illustration. We do
    not need to elaborate on it for the purpose of this document.
    Alas, it should be very obvious to people who are familiar
    with the Quake language, and somewhat obvious to those how don't.</p>
    
    <pre>
proc m3_link (prog, options, objects, imported_libs, shared) is
  local args = []
  if M3_PROFILING args += "-pg" end
  args += [ "-o", prog, options, objects, imported_libs ]
  if shared
    return try_exec ("@" &amp; SYSTEM_CC, args)
  else
    return try_exec ("@" &amp; SYSTEM_CC, "-static", args)
  end
end
</pre>
   
    <h2>The SYSTEM_LIBS Array</h2>
   <p>
   Information about libraries installed on your system is gathered
   in the SYSTEM_LIBS array, which is also defined in <i>cm3.cfg</i>.
   It defines the arguments cm3 should pass as the <i>imported_libs</i>
   argument to <i>m3_link()</i>
   in order to link with a given library. The SYSTEM_LIBS array
   is usually set up by the <i>cminstall</i> program
   during CM3 installation.</p>

   <p>
   Let's look at an example definition (taken from the FreeBSD version):
   </p>

   <pre>
SYSTEM_LIBS = {
  &quot;LIBC&quot;       : [ &quot;-lm&quot; ],
  &quot;FLEX-BISON&quot; : [ &quot;-L/usr/lib&quot;, &quot;-lfl&quot; ],
  &quot;POSTGRES95&quot; : [ &quot;-L/usr/local/lib&quot;, &quot;-lpq&quot; ],
  &quot;OPENGL&quot;     : [ &quot;-L/usr/X11R6/lib&quot;, &quot;-lGLU&quot;, &quot;-lGL&quot;, &quot;-lXext&quot; ],
  &quot;ODBC&quot;       : [ &quot;-L/usr/local/lib&quot;, &quot;-lodbc&quot; ],
  &quot;MOTIF&quot;      : [ &quot;-L/usr/X11R6/lib&quot;, &quot;-lXm&quot; ],
  &quot;X11&quot;        : [ &quot;-L/usr/X11R6/lib&quot;, &quot;-lXaw&quot;, &quot;-lXmu&quot;, &quot;-lXext&quot;,
                        &quot;-lXt&quot;, &quot;-lSM&quot;, &quot;-lICE&quot;, &quot;-lX11&quot; ],
  &quot;TCP&quot;        : [ ]
}
</pre>
   <p>Consider the line</p>
  <pre>
  &quot;POSTGRES95&quot; : [ &quot;-L/usr/local/lib&quot;, &quot;-lpq&quot; ],
   </pre>
   <p><i>&quot;POSTGRES95&quot;</i> is the name the library can be refered
   to from an m3makefile. To import a system library into a module, the
   <i>import_sys_lib</i> function can be used. For example, you could
   put the following Quake code into an m3makefile to import the
   postgresql system library:</p>
   <pre>
   if SYSTEM_LIBS contains "POSTGRES95"
     import_sys_lib ("POSTGRES95")
   end 
  </pre>

  <p>The part <i>[ &quot;-L/usr/local/lib&quot;, &quot;-lpq&quot; ] </i>
   contains the flags that will be passed in the  to link an
   executable with the system library.</p>


  <p>You can add further linker options to the array. Popular
  ones are <i>&quot;-Xlinker&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;-Bdynamic&quot;</i>,
  which together enable dynamic linking on platforms that use the GNU
  linker:</p>
  <p>
   <i>[  &quot;-Xlinker&quot;, &quot;-Bdynamic&quot;,  &quot;-L/usr/local/lib&quot;, &quot;-lpq&quot; ] </i>
   </p>

  <p>
  This is the default on the Linux platform since CM3 5.4, since
  a lot of Linux distributions stopped shipping static libraries.</p>
  </p>

  <p>The line:</p>
  <pre>
  &quot;TCP&quot;        : [ ]
  </pre>
  <p>
  in the example indicates that no external libraries are needed
  to link with the TCP library. This is true since the library
  has been integrated into CM3 a long time ago. It is still defined
  in SYSTEM_LIBS for backward compatibility, in case a program expects
  the library to be external.</p>
