Critical Mass Modula-3 5.4.0 released
-------------------------------------
Berlin, 12 December 2006

The elego Software Solutions GmbH is pleased to announce the release
of Critical Mass Modula-3 5.4.0. Modula-3 is a systems programming
language that descends from Mesa, Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+.
The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be
while meeting the needs of modern systems programmers. Modula-3 retains
one of Modula-2's most successful features, the provision for explicit
interfaces between modules. It adds objects and classes, exception
handling, garbage collection, lightweight processes (or threads), and
the isolation of unsafe features.   


Modula-3 is open source and freely distributable.

Besides micellaneous improvements CM3 5.4.0 contains the following
enhancements: 

- updated code generator based on gcc 3.4.5
- use of generational/incremental garbage collection by default
  via compiler support
- system call wrappers not needed anymore for garbage collection support
- support of system-level threading
- updated m3gdb debugger

CM3 5.4.0 supports the following platforms:
FreeBSD4, LINUXLIBC6, SOLgnu, PPC_DARWIN, NetBSD2_i386
