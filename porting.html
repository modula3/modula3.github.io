    <h2>Porting CM3 to a new Platform</h2>

    <p>
      Porting CM3 to a new platform (hardware architecture / operating
      system combination) essentially consists of the following tasks:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Defining the new platform for the compiler frontend (cm3) and
        providing default configuration files
      </li>
      <li>
        Generating a code generator (compiler backend) for the new
        platform, either by using gcc or writing an integrated backend
      </li>
      <li>
        Supplying all the needed runtime support in the standard
        libraries m3core (much) and libm3 (only a few things)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Since the compiler is written almost entirely in Modula-3, you
      then face the task of compiling, assembling, and linking the
      code including all your fine new additions for the new target
      platform. You generally have two choices here:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        If you already have a running Modula-3 compiler on the target
        platform (e.g. PM3 or the original DEC SRC release), you just
        put your code onto the target platform, make it compilable by
        the other compiler, and boot the CM3 system with three
        compilation stages. This procedure is described in more detail
        in <a href="booting.html">Booting CM3 5.1 with PM3 or SRC
        M3</a>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Most times you won't be so lucky to find a working Modula-3
        compiler on your target platform. Then your only choice is
        cross-compiling on an already supported platform, which means
        building a cross-compiler for the new platform, compiling all
        code to assembler statements on the existing platform,
        compiling the few C sources on the new platform (we'll assume
        the existence of a C compiler), and assembling and linking all
        the generated assembler source on the new platform. This
        should produce an at least somewhat working cm3 executable,
        which can then be used to complete the bootstrap process.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In the following sections we'll look at all the things needed to
      be done in turn. We'll assume that you use the gcc backend for
      code generation, and that your platform is already supported
      by gcc. If not, you will have to write the necessary gcc
      extensions, too; but this would be beyond the scope of this
      article.

    <h3>
      <a name="s1">Defining a new platform for the compiler frontend</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
      The first thing you do is choosing a name for the new platform,
      like FreeBSD4 or LINUXLIBC6. We'll assume GREATOS in the
      following description. You then edit the following files:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tt>m3-sys/m3middle/src/Target.m3</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        Add the new target name <tt>GREATOS</tt> to the
        <tt>Systems</tt> array. In the <tt>Init</tt> procedure, append
        a section for <tt>GREATOS</tt> in the case statement. Copy an
        entry that you deem similar to the new target platform, and
        carefully check all the values.
        <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>m3-sys/m3front/src/builtinInfo/InfoModule.m3</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        Add <tt>GREATOS</tt> to <tt>Platform_names</tt>.
        <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>m3-sys/cm3/src/config/GREATOS</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        This is the default configuration file for the new
        platform. It gets copied to cm3/bin/cm3.cfg.default in the
        binary installation archives. Simply copy one from a similar
        system, change the <tt>TARGET</tt> setting to
        <tt>GREATOS</tt>, and adapt the following values and
        procedures:
        <ul>
          <li><tt>OS_TYPE</tt></li>
          <li><tt>WORD_SIZE</tt></li>
          <li><tt>GNU_PLATFORM</tt></li>

          <li><tt>GNU_CFLAGS</tt></li>
          <li><tt>GNU_MAKE</tt></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>m3-sys/cminstall/src/config/GREATOS</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        This is the configuration template that is used by the binary
        installation program. You can skip this for now, but should
        provide one later, containing the same information as in the
        one above, but with additional location and decision
        information.

    <p>
      Create the directories listed below. Start again by copying the
      files for some similar system, then check all the contents for
      the new platform GREATOS.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tt>m3-libs/m3core/src/C/GREATOS</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The interfaces in this directory define simple access to
          POSIX standard input/output, signal, and
          setjmp/longjmp. Check all the type definitions and sizes
          against the corresponding C declarations in your system
          header files in <tt>/usr/include</tt> and
          <tt>/usr/include/sys</tt>. It is very important that the
          jmp_buf size is correct and that setjmp/longjmp save all
          necessary state, including floating point information, as
          this is used for thread switching.
        </p>
        <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>m3-libs/m3core/src/Csupport/GREATOS</tt></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Simply define the correct dtoa interface. Use a symbol from
          your system libraries or the supplied code from another
          platform. 
        </p>
        <p></p>
      </dd>

      <dd>
        <p>
          This directory contains the basic system dependent runtime
          code for your platform. Start with the <tt>RTMachine.i3</tt>
          interface and continue with the signal and thread bits. You
          will probably disable the VM protection needed by the
          incremental and generational garbage collector for the time
          being by setting <tt>VMHeap = FALSE</tt>. VM protection
          needs page protection support from the underlying operating
          system, and a set of wrappers for all system calls. (I'll
          write up something on this topic later.) You can add this
          feature later. Comment all things not needed in the
          accompanying <tt>m3makefile</tt>.
        </p>
        <p></p>

      <dd>
        <p>
          This directory contains the Unix / POSIX interfaces needed
          by the core library. You do not need to write and check
          everything right now, but quite a lot of this stuff is
          needed. Start with <tt>Utypes.i3, Ustat.i3, Uerror.i3,
          Uexec.i3, Usignal.i3, Uuio.i3, Udir.i3, Unix.i3</tt>.
          I think this should be enough for a simple working
          compiler :-)

    <p>
      If you've got so far, you've almost finished your task. There
      are still some simple adjustments to be made.
      Edit the following files:

    <h3>
      <a name="s3">Building a cross compiler</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
      Add an entry for GREATOS to <tt>Platform_info</tt> in 
      <tt>m3-sys/m3cc/src/m3makefile</tt>. This defines the GNU
      platform description used for your new target machine. You
      should now be able to build a cross compiler on your host system
      with the command
    </p>

    <pre>
  cm3 -build -DM3CC_HOST=HOST_SYSTEM -DM3CC_TARGET=GREATOS
    </pre>

    <p>
      You may also need to add some more magic stuff depending on your
      new target architecture (look for DS3100 and ALPHA_OSF for
      examples). The generated cross-compiler will be in 
      <tt>HOST_SYSTEM/cm3cg</tt>. Copy this executable to the
      <tt>bin</tt> directory of your installation (usually
      <tt>/usr/local/cm3/bin</tt>) as <tt>cm3cg-GREATOS</tt>. Do not
      accidentally overwrite the existing code generator for HOST_SYSTEM!
    </p>

    <p>
      You now should have a working compiler backend for GREATOS, but
      you still need a compiler frontend that knows about
      GREATOS. Recompile the following packages in this order:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><tt>m3-libs/m3core</tt></li>
      <li><tt>m3-libs/libm3</tt></li>
      <li><tt>m3-sys/m3middle</tt></li>
      <li><tt>m3-sys/m3linker</tt></li>
      <li><tt>m3-sys/m3front</tt></li>
      <li><tt>m3-sys/m3quake</tt></li>
      <li><tt>m3-sys/cm3</tt></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      You can use the scripts in <tt>cm3/scripts</tt> to perform the
      compilations. 
      Backup the existing compiler in
      <tt>/usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3-old</tt>, and install the new
      compiler as <tt>/usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3</tt>.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h3>
      <a name="s4">Producing assembler code on the host platform</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
      If you have built and installed the cross compiler frontend and
      backend, you need to edit
      <tt>/usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3.cfg</tt>. Change the definition for
      <tt>m3back</tt> to <tt>... cm3cg-GREATOS</tt> and set
      <tt>M3_BOOTSTRAP = TRUE</tt> at the end of the file. Also change
      the <tt>TARGET</tt> to <tt>GREATOS</tt> at the top.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should now be able to compile all the packages from the
      previous step again, this time generating assembler code in the
      GREATOS subdirectories.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h3>
      <a name="s5">Assembling and linking the front end on the
        target platform</a> 
    </h3>

    <p>
      Copy the <tt>m3-libs</tt> and <tt>m3-sys</tt> hierarchies (or
      just the packages named above) including the generated assembler
      code to the new platform. Use the system assembler, C
      compiler, archiver, and linker to build all the libraries in the
      GREATOS sub-directory. As I don't know about these tools before,
      I cannot give more detailed instructions about the exact
      commands needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Create an empty cm3 directory structure on your target system
      (<tt>cm3/scripts/create-skel.sh</tt>). Install the newly linked
      cm3 executable and the default configuration file cm3.cfg in the
      <tt>bin</tt> directory of this structure. Add this directory to
      your <tt>PATH</tt>.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h3>
      <a name="s6">Building a code generator on the target
        platform</a>

    </p>

    <pre>
  cm3 -build -DM3CC_HOST=GREATOS -DM3CC_TARGET=GREATOS
    </pre>

    <p>
      to build the code generator and install it as
      <tt>/usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3cg</tt>. 
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h3>
      <a name="s7">Recompiling everything on the target platform</a>
    </h3>

    <p>
      You should now have a working compiler and proceed to build
      itself with it. You can use the scripts
      <tt>cm3/scripts/do-cm3-min.sh</tt> and
      <tt>cm3/scripts/boot-cm3-with-m3.sh</tt>, or just
      <tt>cm3/scripts/do-pkg.sh</tt> with all the package names, i.e.
    </p>

    <pre>
  ./do-pkg.sh build m3core libm3 m3middle m3linker m3front m3quake cm3
  ./do-pkg.sh buildship m3core libm3 m3middle m3linker m3front m3quake cm3
    </pre>

    <p>
      Only do the second step if the build succeeded. You can now
      start to clean everything up, add all the missing bits (system
      interfaces, vm protection, etc.), and build all the rest of the
      CM3 packages.
